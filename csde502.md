# Introduction and Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This is the main course notes for CSDE 502 for Winter 2022. It will contain or link to all lecture notes, code examples, exercises, and assignments. We will review these course notes during lecture. Assignment answer keys will be provided on the Canvas site, accessible only to currently enrolled CSDE 502 students.

:::

**Scope:** CSDE 502 is tightly paired with [SOC/CSSS/CSDE 533 A (Research Methods in Demography)](https://hanowell.github.io/uwsoc533a/index.html) ("CSDE 533"). Expect to see cross-references in these notes to the notes for CSDE 533 and vice versa. Techniques introduced in this course will be applied in CSDE 533. Some analytic topics introduced in CSDE 533 will be covered in more depth, with explanation of the data and processing in these notes.

**Objectives:** Upon completion, you will be familiar with a range of data processing approaches for quantitative demographic analysis. These skills will support your understanding and use of concepts and tools of demography introduced in CSDE 533.

**Instructor:** [Phil Hurvitz](gis.washington.edu/phurvitz), phurvitz@uw.edu<br>
Office hours: by appointment; see [my calendar](http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/calendar) and suggest times to meet.

Class meetings {.unnumbered}

:::{.rmdnote}
**Course location:** Class meetings will happen initially over Zoom. The Zoom link for this course is [https://washington.zoom.us/j/97609440755](https://washington.zoom.us/j/976094407559). It is not known whether in-person class meetings will be held during Winter 2022.

**Course days and times:** Friday 10:30-12:20<br>
Please come to class promptly at the scheduled time. There will be a 10-minute break about halfway through each class session.

**Canvas site:** The course has a Canvas site [https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1515226](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1515226), which will be used for collection of assignments and distribution of graded assignments. The site may also be used for distribution of data sets used in the course.
:::

**Class format**

Default class-time agenda:

1. Address outstanding issues from previous sessions or assignments (~10 minutes)
1. A brief lecture to introduce the topics of the day (~5 minutes)
1. A hands-on instructional session (~75 minutes)
1. Overview/clarification of assignment (~10 minutes)

### Computing {.unnumbered}
We will do our assignments in R. Use an Internet-connected computer provisioned with the latest versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) [-@R-base], [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), and the latest versions of following R packages:

* [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) [-@R-knitr]
* [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) [-@R-kableExtra]
* [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) [-@R-rmarkdown]
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) [-@tidyverse]

Other packages will be used, to be installed as necessary during in-class exercises.

All computing for this course should optimally be done on CSDE Terminal Servers (TS). Those students that already have TS access (e.g., CSDE trainees) should be able to use their existing TS1, TS2, or TS3 accounts, but are encouraged to use TS4 for this course so that we will all be using the same environment. More recent student CSDE computing accounts for the general UW student population will use TS4 (csde-ts4.csde.washington.edu).

Most students have computers capable of running R and handling relatively large data sets. However, using a common computing environment will help us avoid some of the problems associated with running the same code on different machines that have different operating systems, processors, RAM, graphics cards, R versions, etc. This will aid in troubleshooting any problems that arise. You may use your own computer during lessons, but only limited time will be available if problems arise due to your computer's unique environment that cannot be addressed quickly.

In order to get access to the CSDE Terminal Servers, see [CSDE Computing Accounts](https://csde.washington.edu/computing/accounts/). All students at UW who pay the [Student Technology Fee](https://uwstf.org/) are legible to obtain CSDE computing accounts.

For information about the CSDE Terminal Servers, see [Choosing a Terminal  Server](https://csde.washington.edu/computing/resources/#TerminalServerChoosing). For instructions on connecting to a Terminal Server, see [Computing tutorials](https://csde.washington.edu/computing/tutorials/).

In order to make remote connections to TS4, you will need a remote desktop protocol (RDP) client. Windows has a built-in "Remote Desktop" application. The same is available for Macs at the Apple Store. Windows users may also want to use [mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/), which I find to be a bit more full-featured than the built-in Windows application. For example, mRemoteNG can have any window size, whereas the Windows RDP application has fixed size that must be specified at the time of connection. Linux users can use [Remmina](https://sourceforge.net/projects/remmina/).

In addition to the RDP client, in order to access any of CSDE's computing resources, it is necessary to install and enable Husky OnNet, the UW virtual private network (VPN) client. Instructions are available at [Download and use Husky OnNet](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/about-husky-onnet/use-husky-onnet/)

### Assignments and grading {.unnumbered}
Each week there will be an assignment made available at 12:00 on the day of class meetings. The assignments are designed to allow students to practice the skills introduced in class sessions. Assignments are due at 09:00 AM on Friday of the week following when the assignment was distributed; answer keys will be posted at this time. Because the answer keys are posted at the due date/time, late work will not be reviewed.

Assignments will be reviewed thoroughly and returned with relevant mark-up, corrections, suggestions, etc. and returned via the course Canvas site.

This course is graded credit/no credit. Students should complete as much of each of the assignments as they can within a reasonable amount of time.

## Course policies {.unnumbered}

## About this web site
This web site was built in R using Rmarkdown and [bookdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bookdown/) with the [bs4_book](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/bs4_book.html) template, which uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. One of the unfortunate side effects of this format is that all captions are placed _below_ the table or figure!

This web site was built in R using Rmarkdown and [bookdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bookdown/) with the [bs4_book](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/bs4_book.html) template, which uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. One of the unfortunate side effects of this format is that all captions are placed _below_ the table or figure! 

<h4>Source code for this document</h4>
Each of the pages in this book will have a section at the bottom including the source code for the page.

## Getting started on Terminal Server 4 {#gettingstarted}
First, if you are not on campus, make sure you have the Husky OnNet VPN application running and have connected to the UW network. You should see the f5 icon in your task area:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_40_25-.png)

Connect to TS4: `csde-ts4.csde.washington.edu`

If you are using the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection, your connection parameters should look like this:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_48_03-Remote Desktop Connection.png)

If you are using mRemoteNG, the connection parameters will match this:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_37_36-Window.png)

Once you are connected you should see a number of icons on the desktop and application shortcuts in the Start area.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_59_38-.png)

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_00_14-Window.png)

Open a Windows Explorer (if you are running RDP in full screen mode you should be able to use the key combination Win-E).

Before doing anything, let's change some of the annoying default settings of the Windows Explorer. Tap `File > Options`. In the `View` tab, make sure that `Always show menus` is checked and `Hide extensions for known file types` is unchecked. The latter setting is very important because we want to see the complete file name for all files at all times.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_30_46-Folder_Options.png)

Click `Apply to Folders` so that these settings become default. Click `Yes` to the next dialog.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_31_37-FolderViews.png)

Now let's make a folder for the files in this course.

Navigate to This PC:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_05_59-Window.png)

You should see the `H:` drive. This is is the mapped drive that links to your [U Drive](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/online-storage/u-drive-central-file-storage-for-users/), and is the place where all of the data for this course is to be stored. __Do not store any data on the `C:` drive!__ The `C:` drive can be wiped without any prior notification.

__Be very careful with your files on the U Drive!__ If you delete files, there is no "undo" functionality. When you are deleting files, you will get a warning that you should take seriously:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_01_10-Delete_Folder.png)

Navigate into `H:` and create a new folder named `csde502_winter_2022`. Note the use of lowercase letters and underscores rather than spaces. This will be discussed in the section on file systems later in this lesson.

## Introduction to R Markdown in RStudio {#intrormd}

### Create a project
Now we will use RStudio to create the first R Markdown source file and render it to HTML.

Start RStudio by either dbl-clicking the desktop shortcut or navigating to the alphabetical R section of the Start menu:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_05_49-Window.png)

:::{.rmdnote}
A brief aside: install `tidyverse`
One of the R packages we will use frequently is [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), which is itself a collection of several other packages, each with a specific domain: 

* `ggplot2` (graphics)
* `dplyr` (data manipulation)
* `tidyr` (reformatting data for efficient processing)
* `readr` (reading rectangular R x C data)
* `purrr` (functional programming, e.g., to replace `for()` loops)
* `tibble` (enhanced data frames)
* `stringr` (string, i.e., text manipulation)
* `forcats` (handling factor, i.e., categorical variables)

We will touch on some of these during this course, but there will not be a full review or treatment of the `tidyverse`.

To get started, because it usually takes some time to install, open a second RStudio session and at the console, to install `tidyverse`, the other packages for CSDE 533, and for this lesson, enter

```
install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, R Markdown, knitr, kableExtra, readstata13))
```

Now continue on with the lesson....
:::

Create a new project (`File > New Project...`).

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_08_34-rstudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Since we just created the directory to house the project, select `Existing Directory`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_09_11-csde502_winter_2021_course-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Navigate to that directory and select `Open`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_09_48-ChooseDirectoryrappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Click `Create Project`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_10_02-csde502_winter_2021_course-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

You will now have a blank project with only the project file.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_11_16-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

### Create an R Markdown file from built-in RStudio functionality
Let's make an R Markdown file (`File > New File > R Markdown...`).

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_12_31-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Do not change any of the metadata ... this is just for a quick example.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_13_41-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Click `OK` and then name the file `week_01.Rmd`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_14_59-SaveFile-Untitled1rappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

#### Render the Rmd file as HTML

At the console prompt, enter `R Markdown::render("W` and tap the `TAB` key. This should bring up a list of files that have the character "w" in the file name. Click `week_01.Rmd`.

The syntax here means "run the `render()` function from the `R Markdown` package on the file `week_01.Rmd`"

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_15_32-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

After a few moments, the process should complete with a message that the output has been created.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_16_13-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

You should see `week_01.html` in the list of files. Click it and select `View in Web Browser`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_16_39-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

You will now see the bare-bones HTML file.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_17_10-Untitled.png)

Compare the output of this file with the source code in `week_01.Rmd`. Note there are section headers that begin with hash marks, and R code is indicated with the starting characters 

<code>
\`\`\`\{r\}
</code>

and the ending characters

<code>
\`\`\`
</code>

Next, we will explore some enhancements to the basic R Markdown syntax.

### Create an R Markdown file with some enhancements

Download this version of [`week_01.Rmd`](files/week_01.Rmd) and overwrite the version you just created.

If RStudio prints a message that some packages are required but are not installed, click `Install`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_26_55-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Change line 3 to include your name and e-mail address. 

![](images/week01/2021-01-08_00_35_18-Window.png)

#### Render and view the enhanced output
Repeat the rendering process (`R Markdown::render("Week_01.Rmd")`) 

The new HTML file has a number of enhancements, including a table of contents at the upper left, a table that is easier to read, a Leaflet map, captions and cross-references for the figures and table, an image derived from a PNG file referenced by a URL, the code used to generate various parts of the document that are produced by R code, and the complete source code for the document. A downloadable version of the rendered file: [week_01.html](files/week_01.html).

![](images/week01/2021-01-08_00_19_27-Week01.png)

Including the source code for the document is especially useful for readers of your documents because it lets them see exactly what you did. An entire research chain can be documented in this way, from reading in raw data, performing data cleaning and analysis, and generating results.

## R data types {#rdatatypes}
There are six fundamental data types in R:

1. logical
1. numeric
1. integer
1. complex
1. character
1. raw

The most atomic object in R will exist having one of those data types, described below. An atomic object of the data type can have a value, `NA` which represents an observation with no data (e.g., a missing measurement), or `NULL` which isn't really a value at all, but can still have the data type class.

You will encounter other data types, such as `Date` or `POSIXct` if you are working with dates or time stamps. These other data types are extensions of the fundamental data types.

To determine what data type an object is, use `is(obj)`, `str(obj)`, or `class(obj)`. 


```r
print(is("a"))
```

```
## [1] "character"           "vector"              "data.frameRowLabels"
## [4] "SuperClassMethod"
```

```r
print(str(TRUE))
```

```
##  logi TRUE
## NULL
```

```r
print(class(123.45))
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
print(class(as.integer(1000)))
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
n <- as.numeric(999999999999999999999)

print(class(n))
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

### Logical
Use `logical` values for characteristics that are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Note that if `logical` elements can also have an `NA` value if the observation is missing. In the following examples, 


```r
# evaluate as logical, test whether 1 is greater than two
a <- 1 > 2
```


```r
# create two numerical values, one being NA, representing ages
age_john <- 39
age_jane <- NA

# logical NA from Jane's undefined age
(jo <- age_john > 50)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
(ja <- age_jane > 50)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

Logical values are often expressed in binary format as 0 = `FALSE` and ` = `TRUE`. in R these values are interconvertible. Other software (e.g., Excel, MS Access) may convert logical values to numbers that you do not expect.


```r
(t <- as.logical(1))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
(f <- as.logical(0))
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

### Numeric
`Numeric` values are numbers with range about 2e-308 to 2e+308, depending on the computer you are using. You can see the possible range by entering `.Machine` at the R console. These can also include decimals. For more information, see [Double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)


### Integer
`Integer` values are numerical, but can only take on whole, rather than fractional values, and have a truncated range compared to `numeric`. For example, see below, if we try to create an integer that is out of range. The object we created is an integer, but because it is out of range, is value is set to `NA`.


```r
i <- as.integer(999999999999999999999)
```

```
## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion to integer range
```

```r
print(class(i))
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

### Complex
The `complex` type is used in mathematics and you are unlikely to use it in applied social science research unless you get into some heavy statistics. See [Complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) for a full treatment.

### Character
`Character` data include the full set of keys on your keyboard that print out a character, typically [A-Z], [a-z], [0-9], punctuation, etc. The full set of ASCII characters is supported, e.g. the `accent aigu` in Café:


```r
print(class("Café"))
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

Also numbers can function as characters. Be careful in converting between numerical and character versions. For example, see these ZIP codes:


```r
# this is a character
my_zip <- "98115"

# it is not numeric.
my_zip + 2
```

```
## Error in my_zip + 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator
```


```r
# we can convert it to numeric, although it would be silly to do with ZIP codes, which are nominal values
as.numeric(my_zip) + 2
```

```
## [1] 98117
```

```r
# Boston has ZIP codes starting with zeros
boston_zip <- "02134"
as.numeric(boston_zip)
```

```
## [1] 2134
```

### Raw
`Raw` values are used to store raw bytes in hexadecimal format. You are unlikely to use it in applied social science research. For example, the hexadecimal value for the character `z` is `7a`:


```r
print(charToRaw("z"))
```

```
## [1] 7a
```

```r
class(charToRaw("z"))
```

```
## [1] "raw"
```


## R data structures {#rdatastructures}

![](images/week02/data_structures.png)

There are 5 basic data structures in R, as shown in the graphic: 

1. vector
1. matrix
1. array
1. list
1. data frame

In addition, the `factor` data type is very important

### Vector
A vector is an ordered set of elements of one or more elements of the same data type and are created using the `c()` constructor function. For example, a single value is a vector:


```r
# create a vector of length 1
a <- 1
is(a)
```

```
## [1] "numeric" "vector"
```


If you try creating a vector with mixed data types, you may get unexpected results; mixing character elements with other type elements will result in character representations, e.g., 


```r
c(1, "a", TRUE, charToRaw("z"))
```

```
## [1] "1"    "a"    "TRUE" "7a"
```

Results will depend on the data type you are mixing, for example because logical values can be expressed numerically, the `TRUE` and `FALSE` values are converted to `1` and `0`, respectively.


```r
(c(1:3, TRUE, FALSE))
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 1 0
```

But if a character is added, all elements are converted to characters.


```r
c(1:3, TRUE, FALSE, "awesome!")
```

```
## [1] "1"        "2"        "3"        "TRUE"     "FALSE"    "awesome!"
```

Order is important, i.e., 

`1, 2, 3` is not the same as `1, 3, 2`

R will maintain the order of elements in vectors unless a process is initiated that changes the order of those elements:


```r
# a vector 
(v <- c(1, 3, 2))
```

```
## [1] 1 3 2
```

```r
(sort(v))
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

You can get some information about vectors, such as length and data type:


```r
# create a random normal 
set.seed(5)
normvec1000 <- rnorm(n = 1000)

length(normvec1000)
```

```
## [1] 1000
```

```r
class(normvec1000)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
class(normvec1000 > 1)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

Elements of vectors are specified with their index number (1 .. n):


```r
v <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)
v[4]
```

```
## [1] 6
```

### Matrix
A matrix is like a vector, in that it an contain only one data type, but it is two-dimensional, having rows and columns. A simple example:


```r
# make a vector 1 to 100
(v <- 1:100)
```

```
##   [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
##  [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36
##  [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54
##  [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72
##  [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90
##  [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100
```

```r
# load to a matrix
(m1 <- matrix(v, ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE))
```

```

```

```r

(m2 <- matrix(v, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE))
```

```

## [10,]   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100
```

If you try to force a vector into a matrix whose row $\times$ col length does not match the length of the vector, the elements will be recycled, which may not be what you want. At least R will give you a warning.


```r
(m3 <- matrix(letters, ncol = 10, nrow = 10))
```

```
## Warning in matrix(letters, ncol = 10, nrow = 10): data length [26] is not a sub-
## multiple or multiple of the number of rows [10]
```

```
##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
##  [1,] "a"  "k"  "u"  "e"  "o"  "y"  "i"  "s"  "c"  "m"  
##  [2,] "b"  "l"  "v"  "f"  "p"  "z"  "j"  "t"  "d"  "n"  
##  [3,] "c"  "m"  "w"  "g"  "q"  "a"  "k"  "u"  "e"  "o"  
##  [4,] "d"  "n"  "x"  "h"  "r"  "b"  "l"  "v"  "f"  "p"  
##  [5,] "e"  "o"  "y"  "i"  "s"  "c"  "m"  "w"  "g"  "q"  
##  [6,] "f"  "p"  "z"  "j"  "t"  "d"  "n"  "x"  "h"  "r"  
##  [7,] "g"  "q"  "a"  "k"  "u"  "e"  "o"  "y"  "i"  "s"  
##  [8,] "h"  "r"  "b"  "l"  "v"  "f"  "p"  "z"  "j"  "t"  
##  [9,] "i"  "s"  "c"  "m"  "w"  "g"  "q"  "a"  "k"  "u"  
## [10,] "j"  "t"  "d"  "n"  "x"  "h"  "r"  "b"  "l"  "v"
```

### Array
An array is similar to matrix, but it can have more than one dimension. These can be useful for analyzing time series data or other multidimensional data. We will not be using array data in this course, but a simple example of creating and viewing the contents of an array:


```r
# a vector 1 to 27
v <- 1:27

# create an array, 3 x 3 x 3
(a <- array(v, dim = c(3, 3, 3)))
```

```
## , , 1
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
## 
## , , 2
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]   10   13   16
## [2,]   11   14   17
## [3,]   12   15   18
## 
## , , 3

##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]   19   22   25
## [2,]   20   23   26
## [3,]   21   24   27
```

```r
# array index is r, c, m (row, column, matrix), e.g., row 1 column 2 matrix 3:
(a[1,2,3])
```

```
## [1] 22
```

### List
R lists are ordered collections of objects that do not need to be of the same data type. Those objects can be single-value vectors, multiple-value vectors, matrices, data frames, other lists, etc. Because of this, lists are a very flexible data type. But because they can have as little or as much structure as you want, can become difficult to manage and analyze.

Here is an example of a list comprised of single value vectors of different data type. Compare this with the attempt to make a vector comprised of elements of different data type:


```r
(l <- list("a", 1, TRUE))
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "a"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] TRUE
```

Let's modify that list a bit:


```r
(l <- list("a", 
           1:20, 
           as.logical(c(0,1,1,0))))
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "a"
## 
## [[2]]
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

The top-level indexing for a list is denoted using two sets of square brackets. For example, the first element of our list can be accessed by `l[[1]]`. For example, the mean of element 2 is obtained by `mean(l[[2]])`: `10.5`.

To perform operations on all elements of a list, use `lapply()`:


```r
# show the data types
(lapply(X = l, FUN = class))
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "character"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "integer"
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] "logical"
```

```r
# mean, maybe?
(lapply(X = l, FUN = function(x) {mean(x)}))
```

```
## Warning in mean.default(x): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] NA
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 10.5
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 0.5
```
### Factor
Factors are similar to vectors, in that they are one-dimensional ordered sets. However, factors also use informational labels. For example, you may have a variable with household income as a text value:

* "<$10,000"
* "$10,000-$549,999"
* "$50,000-$99,999"
* "$100,000-$200,000"
* ">$200,000"

As a vector:


```r
(income <- c("<$10,000"
, "$10,000-$49,999"
, "$50,000-$99,999"
, "$100,000-$200,000"
, ">$200,000"))
```

```
## [1] "<$10,000"          "$10,000-$49,999"   "$50,000-$99,999"  
## [4] "$100,000-$200,000" ">$200,000"
```

Because these are characters, they do not sort in proper numeric order:


```r
sort(income)
```

```
## [1] "$10,000-$49,999"   "$100,000-$200,000" "$50,000-$99,999"  
## [4] "<$10,000"          ">$200,000"
```

If these are treated as a factor, the levels can be set for proper ordering:


```r
# create a factor from income and set the levels
(income_factor <- factor(x = income, levels = income))
```

```
## [1] <$10,000          $10,000-$49,999   $50,000-$99,999   $100,000-$200,000
## [5] >$200,000        
## 5 Levels: <$10,000 $10,000-$49,999 $50,000-$99,999 ... >$200,000
```

```r
# sort again
(sort(income_factor))
```

```
## [1] <$10,000          $10,000-$49,999   $50,000-$99,999   $100,000-$200,000
## [5] >$200,000        
## 5 Levels: <$10,000 $10,000-$49,999 $50,000-$99,999 ... >$200,000
```

As a factor, the data can also be used in statistical models and the magnitude of the variable will also be correctly ordered.

### Data frame
Other than vectors, data frames are probably the most used data type in R. You can think of data frames as matrices that allow columns with different data type. For example, you might have a data set that represents subject IDs as characters, sex or gender as text, height, weight, and age as numerical values, income as a factor, and smoking status as logical. Because a matrix requires only one data type, it would not be possible to store all of these as a matrix. An example:


```r
# income levels 
inc <- c("<$10,000"
, "$10,000-$49,999"
, "$50,000-$99,999"
, "$100,000-$200,000"
, ">$200,000")

BMI <-  data.frame(
   sid = c("A1001", "A1002", "B1001"),
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height_cm = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight_kg = c(81, 93, 78),
   age_y = c(42, 38, 26),
   income = factor(c("$50,000-$99,999", "$100,000-$200,000", "<$10,000"), levels = inc)
)
print(BMI)
```

```
##     sid gender height_cm weight_kg age_y            income
## 1 A1001   Male     152.0        81    42   $50,000-$99,999
## 2 A1002   Male     171.5        93    38 $100,000-$200,000
## 3 B1001 Female     165.0        78    26          <$10,000
```

## File systems {#filesystems}
Although a full treatment of effective uses of file systems is beyond the scope of this course, a few basic rules are worth covering:

1. Never use spaces in folder or file names. 
    Ninety-nine and 44/100ths percent of the time, most modern software will have no problems handling file names with spaces. But that 0.56% of the time when software chokes, you may wonder why your processes are failing. If your directly and file names do not have spaces, then you can at least rule that out!
1. Use lowercase letters in directory and file names.
    In the olden days (MS-DOS), there was not case sensitivity in file names. UNIX has has always used case sensitive file names. So 
    `MyGloriousPhDDissertation.tex` and `mygloriousphddissertation.tex` could actually be different files. Macs, being based on a UNIX kernel, also employ case sensitivity in file names. But Windows? No. Consider the following: there cannot be both `foo.txt` and `FOO.txt` in the same directory. 
    ![](images/week01/2021-01-08_01_13_50-CommandPrompt.png)
    
    So if Windows doesn't care, why should we? Save yourself some keyboarding time and confusion by using only lowercase characters in your file names.
1. Include dates in your file names.
    If you expect to have multiple files that are sequential versions of a file in progress, an alternative to using a content management system such as [git](https://git-scm.com/), particularly for binary files such as Word documents or SAS data files, is to have multiple versions of the files but including the date as part of the file name. If you expect to have multiple versions on the same date, include a lowercase alphabetical character; it is improbable that you would have more than 26 versions of a fine on a single calendar date. If you are paranoid, use a suffix number `0000`, `0002` .. `9999`. If you have ten thousand versions of the same file on a given date, you are probably doing something that is not right.
    Now that you are convinced that including dates in file names is a good idea, _please_ use the format `yyyy-mm-dd` or `yyyymmdd`. If you do so, your file names will sort in temporal order.
1. Make use of directories! 
   Although a folder containing 100,000 files can be handled programatically (if file naming conventions are used), it is not possible for a human being to visually scan 100,000 file names. If you have a lot of files for your project, consider creating directories, e.g., 
       - raw_data
       - processed_data
       - analysis_results
       - scripts
       - manuscript
1. Agonize over file names. 
    Optimally when you look at your file names, you will be able to know something about the content of the file. We spend a lot of time doing analysis and creating output. Spending an extra minute thinking about good file names is time well spent.


## Data manipulation in the `tidyverse`
This section will introduce some of the main workhorse functions in tidy data handling. 

Installing tidyverse is straightforward but it may take some time to download and install all of the packages. If you have not done so yet, use

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

For today's lesson we will be using one of the Add Health public use data sets, [AHwave1_v1.dta](data/AHwave1_v1.dta). 


```r
# install package?
install.packages("pacman", repos = "https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/")
```

```
## package 'pacman' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
## 
## The downloaded binary packages are in
## 	C:\Temp\15\RtmpALq15l\downloaded_packages
```

```r
pacman::p_load(readstata13)

# read the dta file
dat <- readstata13::read.dta13(file.path(myurl, "data/AHwave1_v1.dta"))
```

The data set includes variable labels, which make handling the data easier. Here we print the column names and their labels. Wrapping this in a `DT::data_table` presents a nice interface for showing only a few variables at a time and that allows sorting and searching.


```r
x <- data.frame(colname = names(dat), label = attributes(dat)$var.labels)
DT::datatable(data = x, caption = "Column names and labels in AHwave1_v1.dta.")
```

```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-a43fb2b03822b32eaf61" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-a43fb2b03822b32eaf61">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"caption":"<caption>Column names and labels in

### magrittr{#magrittr}
![](images/week02/unepipe.jpeg)

The R package [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/index.html) allows the use of "pipes". In UNIX, pipes were used to take the output of one program and to feed as input to another program. For example, the UNIX command `cat` prints the contents of a text file. This would print the contents of the file `00README.txt`:

```cat 00README.txt```

but with large files, the entire contents would scroll by too fast to read. Using a "pipe", denoted with the vertical bar character `|` allowed using the `more` command to print one screen at a time by tapping the `Enter` key for each screen full of text:

```cat 00README.txt | more```

As shown in these two screen captures:

![](images/week02/cat_more.png)

![](images/week02/cat_more2.png)

The two main pipe operators we will use in `magrittr` are `%>%` and '%<>%'.

`%>%` is the pipe operator, which functions as a UNIX pipe, that is, to take something on the left hand side of the operator and feed it to the right hand side. 

`%<>%` is the assignment pipe operator, which takes something on the left hand side of the operator, feeds it to the right hand side, and replaces the object on the left-hand side.

For a simple example of the pipe, to list only the first 6 lines of a data frame in base R, we use `head()`, e.g.,


```r
head(iris)
```

```
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```

using a tidy version of this:


```r
iris %>% head()
```

```
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```

In the R base version, we first read `head`, so we know we will be printing the first 6 elements of something, but we don't know what that "something" is. We have to read ahead to know we are reading the first 6 records of `iris`. In the tidy version, we start by knowing we are doing something to the data set, after which we know we are printing the first 6 records.

In base R functions, the process is evaluated from the inside out. For example, to get the mean sepal length of the _setosa_ species in iris, we would do this:


```r
mean(iris[iris$Species == 'setosa', "Sepal.Length"])
```

```
## [1] 5.006
```

From the inside out, we read that we are making a subset of `iris` where Species = "setosa", we are selecting the column "Sepal.Length", and taking the mean. However, it requires reading from the inside out. For a large set of nested functions, we would have ` y <- f(g(h((i(x)))))`, which would require first creating the innermost function (`i()`) and then working outward.

In a tidy approach this would be more like y <- x %>% i() %>% h() %>% g() %>% f()` because the first function applied to the data set `x` is `i()`. Revisiting the mean sepal length of _setosa_ irises, example, under a tidy approach we would do this:


```r
iris %>% filter(Species == 'setosa') %>% summarise(mean(Sepal.Length))
```

```
##   mean(Sepal.Length)
## 1              5.006
```

Which, read from left to right, translates to "using the iris data frame, make a subset of records where species is _setosa_, and summarize those records to get the mean value of sepal length." The tidy version is intended to be easier to write, read, and understand. The command uses the `filter()` function, which will be described below.

### Data subsetting (dplyr)
`dplyr` is the tidyverse R package used most frequently for data manipulation. Selection of records (i.e., subsetting) is done using logical tests to determine what is in the selected set. First we will look at logical tests and then we will cover subsetting rows and columns from data frames.

##### Logical tests
If elements meet a logical test, they will end up in the selected set. If data frame records have values in variables that meet logical criteria, the records will be selected. 

Some logical tests are shown below.

###### `==`: equals


```r
# numeric tests
(1 == 2)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```


```r
(1 == 3 - 2)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```


```r
# character test (actually a factor)
(dat$imonth %>% head() %>% str_c(collapse = ", "))

###### `!`: invert, or "not"
Sometimes it is more convenient to negate a single condition rather than enumerating all possible matching conditions.


```r

#### Subset rows (`filter()`)
The `filter()` function creates a subset of records based on a logical test. Logical tests can be combined as "and" statements using the `&` operator and "or" statements using the `|` operator. Here we will perform a few filters on a subset of the data.


```r
# first 20 records, fist 10 columns
dat_sub <- dat[1:20, 1:10]
kable(dat_sub, format = "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Although these examples are silly and trivial, they show how `filter()` is used to create a selected set of data

#### Subset columns (`select()`)
A subset of columns can be extracted from data frames using the `select()` function, most simply using  named list of columns to keep.


```r
# select 3 columns
(dat_sub_sel <- dat_sub %>%   
    select("aid", "imonth", "iday"))
```

```
##         aid        imonth iday

`select()` can also be used to rename columns:


```r
#select one column, rename two columns
(dat_sub_sel %>% 
   select(aid, Month = imonth, Day = iday))
```

```
##         aid         Month Day
## 1  57100270      (6) June  23
## 2  57101310       (5) May   5
## 3  57103171      (6) June  27
## 4  57103869      (7) July  14
## 5  57104553      (7) July  14
## 6  57104649      (6) June  12
## 7  57104676       (5) May  31
## 8  57109625      (6) June   7
## 9  57110897      (6) June  27
## 10 57111071    (8) August   3
## 11 57111786 (9) September   7
## 12 57113943       (5) May  20
## 13 57116359      (6) June  24
## 14 57117542      (7) July  11
## 15 57117997       (5) May  20
## 16 57118381       (5) May   6
## 17 57118943      (7) July  19
## 18 57120005       (5) May  25
## 19 57120046    (8) August  20
## 20 57120371      (7) July  20
```

Or column renaming can be done with `rename()`, which maintains all input data and only changes the named columns:


```r
(dat_sub_sel %>% 
   rename(Month = imonth, Day = iday))
```

```
##         aid         Month Day     iyear
## 1  57100270      (6) June  23 (95) 1995
## 2  57101310       (5) May   5 (95) 1995
## 3  57103171      (6) June  27 (95) 1995
## 4  57103869      (7) July  14 (95) 1995
## 5  57104553      (7) July  14 (95) 1995
## 6  57104649      (6) June  12 (95) 1995
## 7  57104676       (5) May  31 (95) 1995
## 8  57109625      (6) June   7 (95) 1995
## 9  57110897      (6) June  27 (95) 1995
## 10 57111071    (8) August   3 (95) 1995
## 11 57111786 (9) September   7 (95) 1995
## 12 57113943       (5) May  20 (95) 1995
## 13 57116359      (6) June  24 (95) 1995
## 14 57117542      (7) July  11 (95) 1995
## 15 57117997       (5) May  20 (95) 1995
## 16 57118381       (5) May   6 (95) 1995
## 17 57118943      (7) July  19 (95) 1995
## 18 57120005       (5) May  25 (95) 1995

## 20 57120371      (7) July  20 (95) 1995
```

#### Subset rows and columns: `filter()` and `select()`
We can combine `filter()` and `select()` with a pipe to create a new data frame with a subset of rows and columns:


```r
# records with day of month > 15 and the first 3 named columns
(x <- dat_sub %>% 
    filter(iday > 15) %>%
    select(aid, imonth, iday)
   )
```

```
##         aid     imonth iday
## 1  57100270   (6) June   23
## 2  57103171   (6) June   27
## 3  57104676    (5) May   31
## 4  57110897   (6) June   27
## 5  57113943    (5) May   20
## 6  57116359   (6) June   24
## 7  57117997    (5) May   20
## 8  57118943   (7) July   19
## 9  57120005    (5) May   25
## 10 57120046 (8) August   20
## 11 57120371   (7) July   20
```

#### Create or calculate columns: `mutate()`
`mutate()` will create new named columns or re-calculate existing columns. Here we will make a column that stratifies birth month, with the cut at June. 

Although the birth month column (`h1gi1m`) is a factor, it is unordered, so we need to make it ordered before using the factor label in a numeric comparison. Fortunately, the factor labels were handled in correct order:


```r
# is this ordered?
is.ordered(dat$h1gi1m)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```


```r
# what are the levels?
(levels(dat$h1gi1m))
```

```
##  [1] "(1) January"   "(2) February"  "(3) March"     "(4) April"    
##  [5] "(5) May"       "(6) June"      "(7) July"      "(8) August"   
##  [9] "(9) September" "(10) October"  "(11) November" "(12) December"
## [13] "(96) Refused"
```

Assign order, create a new column, and print nicely:


```r
# make birth month ordered
dat$h1gi1m <- factor(dat$h1gi1m, ordered = TRUE)

# now is it ordered?
is.ordered(dat$h1gi1m)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```


```r
# perform the mutate() using the string representation of the factor for comparison
dat %>% 
    filter(iday > 15) %>%
    select(aid, imonth, iday, birth_month = h1gi1m) %>% 
    mutate(birth_1st_half = (birth_month < "(7) July")) %>% 
    head(20) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

A silly example but showing that `mutate()` can change values of existing columns:


```r
(X <- dat_sub %>% 
     mutate(iday = -1000 + iday))

... so do be careful!

Other functions can be used with mutate include (but are by no means limited to!) 

* `if_else()`: create a column by assigning values based on logical criteria
* `case_when()`: similar to `if_else()` but for multiple input values
* `recode()`: change particular values

When we recoded the birth month, the output was a `logical` data type. If we wanted to create a 
`character` or `factor`, we could use `if_else()`. Here we are creating a new data frame based on several operations on `dat`.


```r
dat_1 <- dat %>% 
    filter(iday > 15) %>%
    head(20) %>%
    select(aid, imonth, iday, birth_month = h1gi1m) %>% 
    mutate(birth_year_half = ifelse(test = birth_month < "(7) July", yes = "first", no = "last"))

# make that a factor
dat_1$birth_year_half <- factor(dat_1$birth_year_half, levels = c("first", "last"))
    
# print
kable(dat_1) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

If one of your variables contains multiple values and you want to create classes, use `case_when()`. Here is a verbose example stratifying months into quarters. Also we are using the `magrittr` assignment pipe to update the input based on the statement, i.e., `dat_1` will change based on the commands we use. __Be careful using the assignment pipe because it will change your data frame.__

`case_when()` will recode in order or the way the command is written, so for months and quarters, it is not necessary to specify both ends of the quarter. Also any cases that are not explicitly handled can be addressed with the `TRUE ~ ...` argument; in this case, any records that had birth months that were not before September get assigned to quarter 4.


```r
dat_1 %<>% 
    mutate(quarter = case_when(
        birth_month < "(3) March" ~ 1,
        birth_month < "(6) June" ~ 2,
        birth_month < "(9) September" ~ 3,
        TRUE ~ 4))

# print
kable(dat_1) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")

#### Summarizing/aggregating data
We will spend more time later in the course on data summaries, but an introduction with `dplyr` is worthwhile introducing at this stage. The two main functions are `summarise()` and `group_by()`.

A simple summary will tabulate the count of respondents and the mean age. The filter `! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")` drops records from respondents who refused to give their birth year.


```r
dat %>% 
    filter(! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")) %>% 
    mutate(yeari = str_replace_all(iyear, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer(),
           yearb = str_replace_all(h1gi1y, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer()) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(),
              mean_age = mean(yeari - yearb))
```

```
##      n mean_age
## 1 6501 16.03676
```

Here we will summarize age by sex using the `group_by()` function, and also piping to `prop_table()` to get the percentage:


```r
dat %>% 
    filter(! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")) %>% 
    mutate(yeari = str_replace_all(iyear, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer(),
           yearb = str_replace_all(h1gi1y, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer()) %>% 
    group_by(bio_sex) %>% 
    summarise(mean_age = mean(yeari - yearb),
              sd_age = sd(yeari - yearb),
              n = n(),
              .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(pct = prop.table(n) * 100)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 5
##   bio_sex    mean_age sd_age     n   pct
##   <fct>         <dbl>  <dbl> <int> <dbl>
## 1 (1) Male       16.1   1.77  3147  48.4
## 2 (2) Female     16.0   1.77  3354  51.6
```

## Getting started on Terminal Server 4 {#gettingstarted}
First, if you are not on campus, make sure you have the Husky OnNet VPN application running and have connected to the UW network. You should see the f5 icon in your task area:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_40_25-.png)

Connect to TS4: `csde-ts4.csde.washington.edu`

If you are using the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection, your connection parameters should look like this:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_48_03-Remote Desktop Connection.png)

If you are using mRemoteNG, the connection parameters will match this:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_37_36-Window.png)

Once you are connected you should see a number of icons on the desktop and application shortcuts in the Start area.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_21_59_38-.png)

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_00_14-Window.png)

Open a Windows Explorer (if you are running RDP in full screen mode you should be able to use the key combination Win-E).

Before doing anything, let's change some of the annoying default settings of the Windows Explorer. Tap `File > Options`. In the `View` tab, make sure that `Always show menus` is checked and `Hide extensions for known file types` is unchecked. The latter setting is very important because we want to see the complete file name for all files at all times.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_30_46-Folder_Options.png)

Click `Apply to Folders` so that these settings become default. Click `Yes` to the next dialog.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_31_37-FolderViews.png)

Now let's make a folder for the files in this course.

Navigate to This PC:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_05_59-Window.png)

You should see the `H:` drive. This is is the mapped drive that links to your [U Drive](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/online-storage/u-drive-central-file-storage-for-users/), and is the place where all of the data for this course is to be stored. __Do not store any data on the `C:` drive!__ The `C:` drive can be wiped without any prior notification.

__Be very careful with your files on the U Drive!__ If you delete files, there is no "undo" functionality. When you are deleting files, you will get a warning that you should take seriously:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_01_10-Delete_Folder.png)

Navigate into `H:` and create a new folder named `csde502_winter_2022`. Note the use of lowercase letters and underscores rather than spaces. This will be discussed in the section on file systems later in this lesson.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_22_32_29-new_folder.png)

## Introduction to R Markdown in RStudio {#intrormd}

### Create a project
Now we will use RStudio to create the first R Markdown source file and render it to HTML.

Start RStudio by either dbl-clicking the desktop shortcut or navigating to the alphabetical R section of the Start menu:

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_05_49-Window.png)

:::{.rmdnote}
A brief aside: install `tidyverse`
One of the R packages we will use frequently is [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), which is itself a collection of several other packages, each with a specific domain: 

* `ggplot2` (graphics)
* `dplyr` (data manipulation)
* `tidyr` (reformatting data for efficient processing)
* `readr` (reading rectangular R x C data)
* `purrr` (functional programming, e.g., to replace `for()` loops)
* `tibble` (enhanced data frames)
* `stringr` (string, i.e., text manipulation)
* `forcats` (handling factor, i.e., categorical variables)

We will touch on some of these during this course, but there will not be a full review or treatment of the `tidyverse`.

To get started, because it usually takes some time to install, open a second RStudio session and at the console, to install `tidyverse`, the other packages for CSDE 533, and for this lesson, enter

```
install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, R Markdown, knitr, kableExtra, readstata13))
```

Now continue on with the lesson....
:::

Create a new project (`File > New Project...`).

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_08_34-rstudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Since we just created the directory to house the project, select `Existing Directory`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_09_11-csde502_winter_2021_course-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Navigate to that directory and select `Open`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_09_48-ChooseDirectoryrappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Click `Create Project`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_10_02-csde502_winter_2021_course-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

You will now have a blank project with only the project file.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_11_16-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

### Create an R Markdown file from built-in RStudio functionality
Let's make an R Markdown file (`File > New File > R Markdown...`).

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_12_31-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Do not change any of the metadata ... this is just for a quick example.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_13_41-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Click `OK` and then name the file `week_01.Rmd`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_14_59-SaveFile-Untitled1rappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

#### Render the Rmd file as HTML

At the console prompt, enter `R Markdown::render("W` and tap the `TAB` key. This should bring up a list of files that have the character "w" in the file name. Click `week_01.Rmd`.

The syntax here means "run the `render()` function from the `R Markdown` package on the file `week_01.Rmd`"

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_15_32-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

After a few moments, the process should complete with a message that the output has been created.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_16_13-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

You should see `week_01.html` in the list of files. Click it and select `View in Web Browser`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_16_39-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

You will now see the bare-bones HTML file.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_17_10-Untitled.png)

Compare the output of this file with the source code in `week_01.Rmd`. Note there are section headers that begin with hash marks, and R code is indicated with the starting characters 

<code>
\`\`\`\{r\}
</code>

and the ending characters

<code>
\`\`\`
</code>

Next, we will explore some enhancements to the basic R Markdown syntax.

### Create an R Markdown file with some enhancements

Download this version of [`week_01.Rmd`](files/week_01.Rmd) and overwrite the version you just created.

If RStudio prints a message that some packages are required but are not installed, click `Install`.

![](images/week01/2021-01-07_23_26_55-csde502_winter_2021-RStudiorappbroker.csde.washington.edu.png)

Change line 3 to include your name and e-mail address. 

![](images/week01/2021-01-08_00_35_18-Window.png)

#### Render and view the enhanced output
Repeat the rendering process (`R Markdown::render("Week_01.Rmd")`) 

The new HTML file has a number of enhancements, including a table of contents at the upper left, a table that is easier to read, a Leaflet map, captions and cross-references for the figures and table, an image derived from a PNG file referenced by a URL, the code used to generate various parts of the document that are produced by R code, and the complete source code for the document. A downloadable version of the rendered file: [week_01.html](files/week_01.html).

![](images/week01/2021-01-08_00_19_27-Week01.png)

Including the source code for the document is especially useful for readers of your documents because it lets them see exactly what you did. An entire research chain can be documented in this way, from reading in raw data, performing data cleaning and analysis, and generating results.

## R data types {#rdatatypes}
There are six fundamental data types in R:

1. logical
1. numeric
1. integer
1. complex
1. character
1. raw

The most atomic object in R will exist having one of those data types, described below. An atomic object of the data type can have a value, `NA` which represents an observation with no data (e.g., a missing measurement), or `NULL` which isn't really a value at all, but can still have the data type class.

You will encounter other data types, such as `Date` or `POSIXct` if you are working with dates or time stamps. These other data types are extensions of the fundamental data types.

To determine what data type an object is, use `is(obj)`, `str(obj)`, or `class(obj)`. 

```{r}
print(is("a"))

print(str(TRUE))

print(class(123.45))

print(class(as.integer(1000)))

n <- as.numeric(999999999999999999999)

print(class(n))
```

### Logical
Use `logical` values for characteristics that are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Note that if `logical` elements can also have an `NA` value if the observation is missing. In the following examples, 

```{r}
# evaluate as logical, test whether 1 is greater than two
a <- 1 > 2
```

```{r}
# create two numerical values, one being NA, representing ages
age_john <- 39
age_jane <- NA

# logical NA from Jane's undefined age
(jo <- age_john > 50)
(ja <- age_jane > 50)
```

Logical values are often expressed in binary format as 0 = `FALSE` and ` = `TRUE`. in R these values are interconvertible. Other software (e.g., Excel, MS Access) may convert logical values to numbers that you do not expect.

```{r}
(t <- as.logical(1))
(f <- as.logical(0))
```

### Numeric
`Numeric` values are numbers with range about 2e-308 to 2e+308, depending on the computer you are using. You can see the possible range by entering `.Machine` at the R console. These can also include decimals. For more information, see [Double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)


### Integer
`Integer` values are numerical, but can only take on whole, rather than fractional values, and have a truncated range compared to `numeric`. For example, see below, if we try to create an integer that is out of range. The object we created is an integer, but because it is out of range, is value is set to `NA`.

```{r}
i <- as.integer(999999999999999999999)

print(class(i))
```

### Complex
The `complex` type is used in mathematics and you are unlikely to use it in applied social science research unless you get into some heavy statistics. See [Complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) for a full treatment.

### Character
`Character` data include the full set of keys on your keyboard that print out a character, typically [A-Z], [a-z], [0-9], punctuation, etc. The full set of ASCII characters is supported, e.g. the `accent aigu` in CafÃ©:

```{r}
print(class("CafÃ©"))
```

Also numbers can function as characters. Be careful in converting between numerical and character versions. For example, see these ZIP codes:

```{r error=TRUE}
# this is a character
my_zip <- "98115"

# it is not numeric.
my_zip + 2
```

```{r}
# we can convert it to numeric, although it would be silly to do with ZIP codes, which are nominal values
as.numeric(my_zip) + 2

# Boston has ZIP codes starting with zeros
boston_zip <- "02134"
as.numeric(boston_zip)
```

### Raw
`Raw` values are used to store raw bytes in hexadecimal format. You are unlikely to use it in applied social science research. For example, the hexadecimal value for the character `z` is `7a`:

```{r}
print(charToRaw("z"))

class(charToRaw("z"))
```


## R data structures {#rdatastructures}

![](images/week02/data_structures.png)

There are 5 basic data structures in R, as shown in the graphic: 

1. vector
1. matrix
1. array
1. list
1. data frame

In addition, the `factor` data type is very important

### Vector
A vector is an ordered set of elements of one or more elements of the same data type and are created using the `c()` constructor function. For example, a single value is a vector:

```{r}
# create a vector of length 1
a <- 1
is(a)
```


If you try creating a vector with mixed data types, you may get unexpected results; mixing character elements with other type elements will result in character representations, e.g., 

```{r}
c(1, "a", TRUE, charToRaw("z"))
```

Results will depend on the data type you are mixing, for example because logical values can be expressed numerically, the `TRUE` and `FALSE` values are converted to `1` and `0`, respectively.

```{r}
(c(1:3, TRUE, FALSE))
```

But if a character is added, all elements are converted to characters.

```{r}
c(1:3, TRUE, FALSE, "awesome!")
```

Order is important, i.e., 

`1, 2, 3` is not the same as `1, 3, 2`

R will maintain the order of elements in vectors unless a process is initiated that changes the order of those elements:

```{r}
# a vector 
(v <- c(1, 3, 2))

(sort(v))
```

You can get some information about vectors, such as length and data type:

```{r}
# create a random normal 
set.seed(5)
normvec1000 <- rnorm(n = 1000)

length(normvec1000)
class(normvec1000)
class(normvec1000 > 1)
```

Elements of vectors are specified with their index number (1 .. n):

```{r}
v <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)
v[4]
```

### Matrix
A matrix is like a vector, in that it an contain only one data type, but it is two-dimensional, having rows and columns. A simple example:

```{r}
# make a vector 1 to 100
(v <- 1:100)

# load to a matrix
(m1 <- matrix(v, ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE))

# different r, c ordering
(m2 <- matrix(v, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE))
```

If you try to force a vector into a matrix whose row $\times$ col length does not match the length of the vector, the elements will be recycled, which may not be what you want. At least R will give you a warning.

```{r}
(m3 <- matrix(letters, ncol = 10, nrow = 10))
```

### Array
An array is similar to matrix, but it can have more than one dimension. These can be useful for analyzing time series data or other multidimensional data. We will not be using array data in this course, but a simple example of creating and viewing the contents of an array:

```{r}
# a vector 1 to 27
v <- 1:27

# create an array, 3 x 3 x 3
(a <- array(v, dim = c(3, 3, 3)))

# array index is r, c, m (row, column, matrix), e.g., row 1 column 2 matrix 3:
(a[1,2,3])
```

### List
R lists are ordered collections of objects that do not need to be of the same data type. Those objects can be single-value vectors, multiple-value vectors, matrices, data frames, other lists, etc. Because of this, lists are a very flexible data type. But because they can have as little or as much structure as you want, can become difficult to manage and analyze.

Here is an example of a list comprised of single value vectors of different data type. Compare this with the attempt to make a vector comprised of elements of different data type:

```{r}
(l <- list("a", 1, TRUE))
```

Let's modify that list a bit:

```{r}
(l <- list("a", 
           1:20, 
           as.logical(c(0,1,1,0))))
```

The top-level indexing for a list is denoted using two sets of square brackets. For example, the first element of our list can be accessed by `l[[1]]`. For example, the mean of element 2 is obtained by `mean(l[[2]])`: ``r mean(l[[2]])``.

To perform operations on all elements of a list, use `lapply()`:

```{r}
# show the data types
(lapply(X = l, FUN = class))

# mean, maybe?
(lapply(X = l, FUN = function(x) {mean(x)}))
```
### Factor
Factors are similar to vectors, in that they are one-dimensional ordered sets. However, factors also use informational labels. For example, you may have a variable with household income as a text value:

* "<$10,000"
* "$10,000-$549,999"
* "$50,000-$99,999"
* "$100,000-$200,000"
* ">$200,000"

As a vector:

```{r}
(income <- c("<$10,000"
, "$10,000-$49,999"
, "$50,000-$99,999"
, "$100,000-$200,000"
, ">$200,000"))
```

Because these are characters, they do not sort in proper numeric order:

```{r}
sort(income)
```

If these are treated as a factor, the levels can be set for proper ordering:

```{r}
# create a factor from income and set the levels
(income_factor <- factor(x = income, levels = income))

# sort again
(sort(income_factor))
```

As a factor, the data can also be used in statistical models and the magnitude of the variable will also be correctly ordered.

### Data frame
Other than vectors, data frames are probably the most used data type in R. You can think of data frames as matrices that allow columns with different data type. For example, you might have a data set that represents subject IDs as characters, sex or gender as text, height, weight, and age as numerical values, income as a factor, and smoking status as logical. Because a matrix requires only one data type, it would not be possible to store all of these as a matrix. An example:

```{r}
# income levels 
inc <- c("<$10,000"
, "$10,000-$49,999"

## File systems {#filesystems}
Although a full treatment of effective uses of file systems is beyond the scope of this course, a few basic rules are worth covering:

1. Never use spaces in folder or file names. 
    Ninety-nine and 44/100ths percent of the time, most modern software will have no problems handling file names with spaces. But that 0.56% of the time when software chokes, you may wonder why your processes are failing. If your directly and file names do not have spaces, then you can at least rule that out!
1. Use lowercase letters in directory and file names.
    In the olden days (MS-DOS), there was not case sensitivity in file names. UNIX has has always used case sensitive file names. So 
    `MyGloriousPhDDissertation.tex` and `mygloriousphddissertation.tex` could actually be different files. Macs, being based on a UNIX kernel, also employ case sensitivity in file names. But Windows? No. Consider the following: there cannot be both `foo.txt` and `FOO.txt` in the same directory. 
    ![](images/week01/2021-01-08_01_13_50-CommandPrompt.png)
    
    So if Windows doesn't care, why should we? Save yourself some keyboarding time and confusion by using only lowercase characters in your file names.
1. Include dates in your file names.
    If you expect to have multiple files that are sequential versions of a file in progress, an alternative to using a content management system such as [git](https://git-scm.com/), particularly for binary files such as Word documents or SAS data files, is to have multiple versions of the files but including the date as part of the file name. If you expect to have multiple versions on the same date, include a lowercase alphabetical character; it is improbable that you would have more than 26 versions of a fine on a single calendar date. If you are paranoid, use a suffix number `0000`, `0002` .. `9999`. If you have ten thousand versions of the same file on a given date, you are probably doing something that is not right.
    Now that you are convinced that including dates in file names is a good idea, _please_ use the format `yyyy-mm-dd` or `yyyymmdd`. If you do so, your file names will sort in temporal order.
1. Make use of directories! 
   Although a folder containing 100,000 files can be handled programatically (if file naming conventions are used), it is not possible for a human being to visually scan 100,000 file names. If you have a lot of files for your project, consider creating directories, e.g., 
       - raw_data
       - processed_data
       - analysis_results
       - scripts
       - manuscript
1. Agonize over file names. 
    Optimally when you look at your file names, you will be able to know something about the content of the file. We spend a lot of time doing analysis and creating output. Spending an extra minute thinking about good file names is time well spent.


## Data manipulation in the `tidyverse`
This section will introduce some of the main workhorse functions in tidy data handling. 

Installing tidyverse is straightforward but it may take some time to download and install all of the packages. If you have not done so yet, use

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

For today's lesson we will be using one of the Add Health public use data sets, [AHwave1_v1.dta](data/AHwave1_v1.dta). 

```{r warning=FALSE}
# install package?
install.packages("pacman", repos = "https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/")
pacman::p_load(readstata13)

# read the dta file
dat <- readstata13::read.dta13(file.path(myurl, "data/AHwave1_v1.dta"))
```

The data set includes variable labels, which make handling the data easier. Here we print the column names and their labels. Wrapping this in a `DT::data_table` presents a nice interface for showing only a few variables at a time and that allows sorting and searching.

```{r}
x <- data.frame(colname = names(dat), label = attributes(dat)$var.labels)
DT::datatable(data = x, caption = "Column names and labels in AHwave1_v1.dta.")
```


### magrittr{#magrittr}
![](images/week02/unepipe.jpeg)

The R package [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/index.html) allows the use of "pipes". In UNIX, pipes were used to take the output of one program and to feed as input to another program. For example, the UNIX command `cat` prints the contents of a text file. This would print the contents of the file `00README.txt`:

```cat 00README.txt```

but with large files, the entire contents would scroll by too fast to read. Using a "pipe", denoted with the vertical bar character `|` allowed using the `more` command to print one screen at a time by tapping the `Enter` key for each screen full of text:

```cat 00README.txt | more```

As shown in these two screen captures:

![](images/week02/cat_more.png)

![](images/week02/cat_more2.png)

The two main pipe operators we will use in `magrittr` are `%>%` and '%<>%'.

`%>%` is the pipe operator, which functions as a UNIX pipe, that is, to take something on the left hand side of the operator and feed it to the right hand side. 

`%<>%` is the assignment pipe operator, which takes something on the left hand side of the operator, feeds it to the right hand side, and replaces the object on the left-hand side.

For a simple example of the pipe, to list only the first 6 lines of a data frame in base R, we use `head()`, e.g.,

```{r}
head(iris)
```

using a tidy version of this:

```{r}
iris %>% head()
```

In the R base version, we first read `head`, so we know we will be printing the first 6 elements of something, but we don't know what that "something" is. We have to read ahead to know we are reading the first 6 records of `iris`. In the tidy version, we start by knowing we are doing something to the data set, after which we know we are printing the first 6 records.

In base R functions, the process is evaluated from the inside out. For example, to get the mean sepal length of the _setosa_ species in iris, we would do this:

```{r}
mean(iris[iris$Species == 'setosa', "Sepal.Length"])
```

From the inside out, we read that we are making a subset of `iris` where Species = "setosa", we are selecting the column "Sepal.Length", and taking the mean. However, it requires reading from the inside out. For a large set of nested functions, we would have ` y <- f(g(h((i(x)))))`, which would require first creating the innermost function (`i()`) and then working outward.

In a tidy approach this would be more like y <- x %>% i() %>% h() %>% g() %>% f()` because the first function applied to the data set `x` is `i()`. Revisiting the mean sepal length of _setosa_ irises, example, under a tidy approach we would do this:

```{r}
iris %>% filter(Species == 'setosa') %>% summarise(mean(Sepal.Length))
```

Which, read from left to right, translates to "using the iris data frame, make a subset of records where species is _setosa_, and summarize those records to get the mean value of sepal length." The tidy version is intended to be easier to write, read, and understand. The command uses the `filter()` function, which will be described below.

### Data subsetting (dplyr)
`dplyr` is the tidyverse R package used most frequently for data manipulation. Selection of records (i.e., subsetting) is done using logical tests to determine what is in the selected set. First we will look at logical tests and then we will cover subsetting rows and columns from data frames.

##### Logical tests
If elements meet a logical test, they will end up in the selected set. If data frame records have values in variables that meet logical criteria, the records will be selected. 

Some logical tests are shown below.

###### `==`: equals

```{r}
# numeric tests
(1 == 2)
```

```{r}
(1 == 3 - 2)
```

```{r}
# character test (actually a factor)
(dat$imonth %>% head() %>% str_c(collapse = ", "))
((dat$imonth == "(6) June") %>% head())
```

```{r}
# character test for multiple patterns
(dat$imonth %in% c("(6) June", "(7) July") %>% head())
```


###### `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`: numeric comparisons

```{r}
1 < 2
```

```{r}
1 > 2
```

```{r}
1 <= -10:10
```

```{r}
1 >= -10:10
```

###### `!=`: not equals

```{r}
1 != 2
```

```{r}
# those of the first 6 days that are not 14
(dat$iday %>% head())
((dat$iday != 14) %>% head())
```

###### `!`: invert, or "not"
Sometimes it is more convenient to negate a single condition rather than enumerating all possible matching conditions.

```{r}
dat$imonth %>% head(20)
((!dat$imonth %in% c("(6) June", "(7) July")) %>% head(20))
```

#### Subset rows (`filter()`)
The `filter()` function creates a subset of records based on a logical test. Logical tests can be combined as "and" statements using the `&` operator and "or" statements using the `|` operator. Here we will perform a few filters on a subset of the data.

```{r}
# first 20 records, fist 10 columns
dat_sub <- dat[1:20, 1:10]
kable(dat_sub, format = "html") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Records from one month:

```{r}
# from May
(dat_sub %>% filter(imonth == "(5) May"))
```

Records from one month from females:

```{r}
(dat_sub %>% filter(imonth == "(5) May" & bio_sex == "(2) Female"))
```

Records from one month and from females or where the day of month was before the 15th, which will probably include some males:

```{r}
(dat_sub %>% filter(imonth == "(5) May" & (bio_sex == "(2) Female") | iday < 15))

```

Although these examples are silly and trivial, they show how `filter()` is used to create a selected set of data

#### Subset columns (`select()`)
A subset of columns can be extracted from data frames using the `select()` function, most simply using  named list of columns to keep.

```{r}
# select 3 columns
(dat_sub_sel <- dat_sub %>%   
    select("aid", "imonth", "iday"))
```

```{r}
# select all but two named columns
(dat_sub_sel <- dat_sub %>%   
    select(-"imonth", -"iday"))
```

```{r}
# select columns by position and whose name matches a pattern, in this case the regular expression "^i" meaning "starts with lowercase i"
(dat_sub_sel <- dat_sub %>%   
    select(1, matches("^i")))
```

`select()` can also be used to rename columns:

```{r}
#select one column, rename two columns
(dat_sub_sel %>% 
   select(aid, Month = imonth, Day = iday))
```

Or column renaming can be done with `rename()`, which maintains all input data and only changes the named columns:

```{r}
(dat_sub_sel %>% 
   rename(Month = imonth, Day = iday))
```

#### Subset rows and columns: `filter()` and `select()`
We can combine `filter()` and `select()` with a pipe to create a new data frame with a subset of rows and columns:

```{r}
# records with day of month > 15 and the first 3 named columns
(x <- dat_sub %>% 
    filter(iday > 15) %>%
    select(aid, imonth, iday)
   )
```

#### Create or calculate columns: `mutate()`
`mutate()` will create new named columns or re-calculate existing columns. Here we will make a column that stratifies birth month, with the cut at June. 

Although the birth month column (`h1gi1m`) is a factor, it is unordered, so we need to make it ordered before using the factor label in a numeric comparison. Fortunately, the factor labels were handled in correct order:

```{r}
# is this ordered?
is.ordered(dat$h1gi1m)
```

```{r}
# what are the levels?
(levels(dat$h1gi1m))
```

Assign order, create a new column, and print nicely:

```{r}
# make birth month ordered
dat$h1gi1m <- factor(dat$h1gi1m, ordered = TRUE)

# now is it ordered?
is.ordered(dat$h1gi1m)
```

```{r}
# perform the mutate() using the string representation of the factor for comparison
dat %>% 
    filter(iday > 15) %>%
    select(aid, imonth, iday, birth_month = h1gi1m) %>% 
    mutate(birth_1st_half = (birth_month < "(7) July")) %>% 
    head(20) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

A silly example but showing that `mutate()` can change values of existing columns:

```{r}
(X <- dat_sub %>% 
     mutate(iday = -1000 + iday))
```

... so do be careful!

Other functions can be used with mutate include (but are by no means limited to!) 

* `if_else()`: create a column by assigning values based on logical criteria
* `case_when()`: similar to `if_else()` but for multiple input values
* `recode()`: change particular values

When we recoded the birth month, the output was a `logical` data type. If we wanted to create a 
`character` or `factor`, we could use `if_else()`. Here we are creating a new data frame based on several operations on `dat`.

```{r}
dat_1 <- dat %>% 
    filter(iday > 15) %>%
    head(20) %>%
    select(aid, imonth, iday, birth_month = h1gi1m) %>% 
    mutate(birth_year_half = ifelse(test = birth_month < "(7) July", yes = "first", no = "last"))

# make that a factor
dat_1$birth_year_half <- factor(dat_1$birth_year_half, levels = c("first", "last"))
    
# print
kable(dat_1) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

If one of your variables contains multiple values and you want to create classes, use `case_when()`. Here is a verbose example stratifying months into quarters. Also we are using the `magrittr` assignment pipe to update the input based on the statement, i.e., `dat_1` will change based on the commands we use. __Be careful using the assignment pipe because it will change your data frame.__

`case_when()` will recode in order or the way the command is written, so for months and quarters, it is not necessary to specify both ends of the quarter. Also any cases that are not explicitly handled can be addressed with the `TRUE ~ ...` argument; in this case, any records that had birth months that were not before September get assigned to quarter 4.

```{r}
dat_1 %<>% 
    mutate(quarter = case_when(
        birth_month < "(3) March" ~ 1,
        birth_month < "(6) June" ~ 2,
        birth_month < "(9) September" ~ 3,
        TRUE ~ 4))

# print
kable(dat_1) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left")
```

`recode()` is used to change the `birth_year_half` column:

```{r}
(dat_1 %<>% 
     mutate(birth_year_half_split = recode(birth_year_half,
                   "first" = "early",
                   "last" = "late")))
```

#### Summarizing/aggregating data
We will spend more time later in the course on data summaries, but an introduction with `dplyr` is worthwhile introducing at this stage. The two main functions are `summarise()` and `group_by()`.

A simple summary will tabulate the count of respondents and the mean age. The filter `! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")` drops records from respondents who refused to give their birth year.

```{r}
dat %>% 
    filter(! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")) %>% 
    mutate(yeari = str_replace_all(iyear, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer(),
           yearb = str_replace_all(h1gi1y, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer()) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(),
              mean_age = mean(yeari - yearb))
```

Here we will summarize age by sex using the `group_by()` function, and also piping to `prop_table()` to get the percentage:

```{r}
dat %>% 
    filter(! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")) %>% 
    mutate(yeari = str_replace_all(iyear, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer(),
           yearb = str_replace_all(h1gi1y, ".* ", "") %>% as.integer()) %>% 
    group_by(bio_sex) %>% 
    summarise(mean_age = mean(yeari - yearb),
              sd_age = sd(yeari - yearb),
              n = n(),
              .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(pct = prop.table(n) * 100)
```

<h2>Topics: R data structures; tidyverse</h2>
It is assumed that students in this course have a basic working knowledge of using R, including how to create variables with the assignment operator ("`<-`"), and how to run simple functions(e.g., `mean(dat$age)`). Often in courses that include using R for statistical analysis, some of the following foundations are not explained fully. This is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of R data types and structures, but should provide some background for students who are either relatively new at using R or who have not had a systematic introduction.

The other main topic for today is ["tidyverse"](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which refers to a related set of R packages for data management, analysis, and display. See Hadley Wickham's [tidy tools manifesto](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html) for the logic behind the suite of tools. For a brief description of the specific R packages, see [Tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). This is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction, but should provide sufficient background for data handling to support most of the technical aspects of the rest of the course.

## Code to run for the in-class exercise



For the exercise in class, download [week02.R](r_code/week02.R), which we will use to run the code listed in this R Markdown result.

## R Markdown 

### Code blocks {#rmdcodeblocks}

### Graphics in R Markdown {#rmdgraphics}
Data-driven graphics in Rmd files are typically created as base R graphics or with the `ggplot2` package. This tutorial is not intended to provide anywhere near a comprehensive treatment of creating graphics from data, but will provide instruction on some options for creating and including data-driven graphics as well as inserting graphics from image files.

See [Tips and tricks for working with images and figures in R Markdown documents](http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/) for a good explanation.

#### Base R graphics
To include base R graphics, simply place the code to generate the graphic in an R code block, e.g., using the Add Health data from last week ([AHWave1_v1.dta](data/AHWave1_v1.dta)):


````
```{r}
# since loading the data takes awhile, only do this if necessary
if(!exists("dat")){
    dat <- read.dta13("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
}
# birth year = h1gi1y
# drop "Refused" birth year
# for birth year and interview year, replace anything before white space, convert to numeric
# subtract interview year - birth year
ages <- dat %>% 
    filter(! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")) %>% 
    select(iyear, h1gi1y) %>% 
    mutate(yi = str_replace(iyear, ".*\\s", "") %>% as.numeric(),
           yb = str_replace(h1gi1y, ".*\\s", "") %>% as.numeric(),
           age = yi - yb)
           
# create a histogram using base graphics
hist(ages$age, xlab = "age (years)", las = 1)
```
````

... which will render the graph:

<img src="02-week02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />

#### `ggplot2` graphics
The `ggplot2` package creates compelling graphics that use a common syntax. The main difference between base R graphics and `ggplot2` graphics is that simply issuing the `plot()` or related command (e.g., `hist()`, `barplot()`) adds the graphic to the output, whereas with `ggplot()` it is necessary to issue a command that prints the graphic.

Following the previous example:


```r
# how many unique bins? 
bins <- length(unique(ages$age))

# create the graphic
g <- ggplot(data = ages, mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = bins)

# print the graphic
print(g)
```

<img src="02-week02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />


#### Embedding graphics files
Journals frequently require graphics files to be submitted separately from the manuscript. In this case, the graphic can be created and saved as a file and then inserted in the Rmd using code, but also accessed as a a stand-alone file. Let's take the previous example, but add correlation coefficients and other embellishments, create a graphics file and add the graphics into the Rmd.

The base graphics file is created using the `pdf()` function, although `png()` also works if that is the desired output format. PDF is a vector format, so it generally renders better over different zoom levels.


```r
pdf(file = "ah_age_hist.pdf", width = 5, height = 5)
hist(ages$age, xlab = "age (years)", las = 1)
x <- dev.off()
```

Here we create a PNG format file:


```r
png(file = "ah_age_hist.png", width = 5, height = 5, units = "in", res = 300)
hist(ages$age, xlab = "age (years)", las = 1)
x <- dev.off()
```

`ggplot2` graphics can be saved using `ggsave()`, e.g., for both PDF and PNG outputs. The `dpi` argument is important for bitmap images.


```r
ggsave(
    filename = "ah_age_hist_ggplot.pdf",
    plot = g, device = "pdf",
    width = 5, height = 5
)
ggsave(
    filename = "ah_age_hist_ggplot.png",
    plot = g, device = "png", 
    width = 5, height = 5, 
    units = "in", dpi = 300
)
```

Graphics can be added using several methods.

##### `knitr`
The `knitr::include_graphics()` function can be used to insert image files, with the caution that inserted PDF files may produce unwanted results. The syntax is:


````
```{r}
include_graphics("graphics_filename")
```
````

and the code chunk can include `out.width`, `out.height` and other options.
\  
Here we insert a PDF with no code chunk options, which presents the image with a scroll bar, rather than the full image:


```r
include_graphics("ah_age_hist.pdf")
```

![](ah_age_hist.pdf)<!-- -->

Here we specify in the code chunk options `out.height = "360px", out.width='360px', fig.align='left'`, 


```r
include_graphics("ah_age_hist.pdf")
```

<embed src="ah_age_hist.pdf" width="360px" height="360px" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" type="application/pdf" />

\  

... and with code chunk options `out.height = "400px", out.width='100%', fig.align='left'`


```r
include_graphics("ah_age_hist.pdf")
```

<embed src="ah_age_hist.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" type="application/pdf" />

\  

It seems that embedding PDF files is not optimal.

Here we insert a PNG: with no code chunk options:


```r
include_graphics("ah_age_hist_ggplot.png")
```

<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png" width="750" />

and with code chunk option `out.width = "50%"`


```r
include_graphics("ah_age_hist_ggplot.png")
```

<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png" width="50%" />

So embedding bitmapped images appears to work better than embedding PDF files. 

##### Markdown: `![caption](filename)`

The native Markdown syntax:

```
![](filename)
```

includes a graphics file with an optional caption, e.g., here, a PDF with no caption, 

`![](ah_age_hist.pdf)`

![](ah_age_hist.pdf)

\  

The structure `![]()` indicates this is an inserted graphic; a caption can be specified by including text within the square brackets, e.g., displays the caption below the inserted image (but with no caption number!). 

```![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.pdf)```

![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.pdf)

... although it seems that inserting a PDF does odd things with image scrolling, while a PNG inserts the complete image without scroll bars.

```![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.png)```:

![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.png)

##### HTML `<img>` tag
If the file is to be rendered as HTML, _and_ the image is a bitmap, rather than vector PDF graphics, the `<img>` tag can be used. Different utilities can be used to convert PDF to bitmapped formats, e.g., [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) and [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/).

```<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png">```

<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png">

Including a percentage of page width:

```<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png" width="30%">```

<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png" width="30%">


### Tables in R Markdown {#rmdtables}

We will look at three methods of including tables in R Markdown documents, using the packages `knitr` (with `kableExtra`), `pander`, and `stargazer`.

For the example table, we will use the frequency table of health $\times$ White and African American from Assignment 2:


```r
dat <- readstata13::read.dta13("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/AHwave1_v1.dta")


# ordered factor; use fct_rev to establish the correct ordering where better health ranks higher
dat %<>% 
    mutate(h1gh1 = fct_rev(as.ordered(h1gh1)))

# stratify health; first we need to catch the "don't know" and "refused" as NAs
dat %<>%  
    mutate(health = 
    case_when(
        h1gh1 <= "(6) Refused" ~ as.character(NA),
        h1gh1 >  "(3) Good" ~ "high",
        h1gh1 <= "(3) Good" ~ "low"
    ))

# tabulate by White
tabhealth_white <- dat %>% 
    group_by(health, white = h1gi6a) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate("%" = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))

# tabulate by African American
tabhealth_afram <- dat %>% 
    group_by(health, afram = h1gi6b) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate("%" = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))

# column-bind and remove the second "health" column
sum_health_white_afram <- cbind(tabhealth_white, tabhealth_afram) %>% 
    select(-5)
```

#### `kntir` (`kable()`) and `kableExtra`
The simple table using `kable()` is not too nice to read.


```r
kable(sum_health_white_afram)
```

<table>

So we add some `kabelExtra` options, :


```r
kable(sum_health_white_afram,
      col.names = c("health", "race", "n", "%", "race", "n", "%")) %>% 
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left") 
```

However, because some column names are duplicated, it is necessary to add some column grouping:

### Captions to support tables, figures, and equations {#rmdcaptions}
There are several ways to support captions in R Markdown. The two main requirements for good captions: (1) automatic sequential numbering, and (2) ability to cross-reference.

Here are some options for adding captions:

#### Figures

##### R Markdown code chunk `fig.cap`
Code chunks can include `fig_cap` as an option, as shown below. However, in standard Rmd $\rightarrow$ HTML there does not appear to be a method for cross-referencing. The code chunk would look like


````
```{r plotcars, fig.cap="Cars: speed and distance"}
plot(cars)
```
````


<div class="figure">
<img src="02-week02_files/figure-html/plotcars-1.png" alt="Cars: speed and distance" width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:plotcars)Cars: speed and distance</p>
</div>

##### `bookdown` with `html_document2` output type

Using the `bookdown` package with `html_document2` output type, it is possible to cross-reference using the chunk name. For example, download and run this code [fig_cap_bookdown.Rmd](files/fig_cap_bookdown.Rmd)

Which renders a file:

![](images/week03/fig_ref.png)

There seems to be no difference in the HTML output using

```
output: 
    bookdown::html_document2:
```

versus 

```
output: 
    html_document:
````

so the former is suggested as one way to include captions that support cross-referencing.

#### Tables: `kable()` "caption"
Tables created with `kable()` can include the `caption` option. For example:


```r
kable(x = sum_health_white_afram, caption = "Self-reported health by race")
```

<table>
<caption>(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-23)Self-reported health by race</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> health...1 </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> white </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> n...3 </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> %...4 </th>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 25.00 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

But there appears to be no direct way of cross-referencing within standard Rmd $\rightarrow$ HTML.

##### `bookdown` with `html_document2` output type

Similarly for figures, the `bookdown` package with `html_document2` output type, it is possible to cross-reference using the chunk name. For example, download and run this code [table_cap_bookdown.Rmd](files/table_cap_bookdown.Rmd)

Which renders a file:

![](images/week03/tab_ref.png)

#### Equations {# rmdequations}
Equations should be numbered in manuscripts. Using `bookdown` makes this quite easy. The equations themselves require $\LaTeX$ syntax. There are numerous web sites with examples and tutorials for creating mathematical expressions with $\LaTeX$ In this example, we include Einstein's famous equation:

<pre>
\begin{equation}
  E=mc^2
  (\#eq:emc)
\end{equation}
</pre>

and the sum of squares:

<pre>
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
  (\#eq:sumn)
\end{equation}
</pre>

The label for the equation is set with `(\#eq:emc)` and can be referenced using `\@ref(eq:emc)`. Operationalized, we see:

Einstein's equation, energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light is shown in \@ref(eq:emc).

\begin{equation}
  E=mc^2
  (\#eq:emc)
\end{equation}

To make a sum of squares of _n_ first integers, see \@ref(eq:sumn).

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
  (\#eq:sumn)
\end{equation}


### `captioner` for any captioning and cross-referencing figures and tables
The `captioner` package provides a flexible, albeit cumbersome, framework for captioning both tables and figures. 

The R code to do this:

```
library(captioner)
table_nums <- captioner(prefix = "Table")
figure_nums <- captioner(prefix = "Figure")
```

The `table_nums()` and `figure_nums()` functions are used to create captions and cross-references, and are not tied to any specific figure or table, as is the case with `kable` table captions and R code chunk `fig.cap`.

A caption is created, e.g., for a figure:

`` `r
figure_nums(name = "figname", caption = "My Caption")` ``

and referenced, e.g., 

`` `r
figure_nums(name = "figname", display = "cite")` ``

It does not matter whether the reference precedes or comes after the caption itself.

Another benefit to using `captioner` is that the output can be formatted using markdown syntax. For example, to format the caption in italics, use underscores:

`` _`r
figure_nums(name = "figname", caption = "My Caption")`_ ``

Although this method requires a bit more coding, it allows great flexibility. A complete example:

As shown in figure  1, the distribution of age has a slight negative skew.


```r
# how many unique bins? 
bins <- length(unique(ages$age))

# create the graphic
g <- ggplot(data = ages, mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = bins)

# print the graphic
print(g)
```

<img src="02-week02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="288" />

_figure  1: Add Health age histogram_

Similarly, we can present the same data as a frequency table, as shown in table  1.

_table  1: Add Health age frequency table_


```r
ages %>% 
    group_by(age) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    mutate(cumsum = cumsum(n),
        "%" = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1),
        "cum %" = round(cumsum(n / sum(n) * 100), 1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
        c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
        full_width = F, 
        position = "left") 
```

<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed table-responsive" style="width: auto !important; ">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> age </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> n </th>

Because of its extensibility, HTML can be considered a preferred output from R Markdown. However, document formats are often necessary, particularly for term papers, theses/dissertations, and manuscripts for submission to scholarly journals. In this week's lesson, we will focus on the creation of these two output types, including adding bibliographies (which also applies to HTML output), and some basic `ggplot` graphics. 

For both PDF and Word output, much of the structure of your Rmd files will be the same as for HTML output. The major difference is how tables are handled, which we will explore in some detail. Static graphics are handled similarly across all output formats, other than HTML output can support dynamic graphics, such as the Leaflet map we saw in the first lesson, and responsive graphics as in [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).


## Getting US Census data with `tigris`, `tidycensus`
Dealing with US Census data can be overwhelming, particularly if using the raw text-based data. The Census Bureau has an API that allows more streamlined downloads of variables (as data frames) and geographies (as simple format shapes). It is necessary to get an API key, available for free. See [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) and  [tidycensus basic usage](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html).

`tidycensus` uses [`tigris`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tigris/versions/1.0), which downloads the geographic data portion of the census files.

A simple example will download the variables representing the count of White, Black/African American, American Indian/Native American, and Asian persons from the American Community Survey (ACS) data for King County in 2019. For this example to run, you need to have your US Census API key installed, e.g., 

<tt>
tidycensus::census_api_key("*****************", install = TRUE)<br>
<font color="red">
Your API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY").<br>
To use now, restart R or run `readRenviron("~/.Renviron")`
</font>
</tt>

The labels from the census API are:

```
"Estimate!!Total"                                         
"Estimate!!Total!!White alone"                            
"Estimate!!Total!!Black or African American alone"        
"Estimate!!Total!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone"
"Estimate!!Total!!Asian alone" 
```


```r
library(tidycensus)
# the census variables
census_vars <- c(
    p_denom_race = "B02001_001",
    p_n_white = "B02001_002",
    p_n_afram = "B02001_003",
    p_n_aian = "B02001_004",
    p_n_asian = "B02001_005"
)

# get the data
ctdat <- get_acs(
    geography = "tract",
    variables = census_vars,
    cache_table = TRUE,
    year = 2019,
    output = "wide",
    state = "WA",
    county = "King",
    geometry = TRUE,
    survey = "acs5"
)
```

```

Because of its extensibility, HTML can be considered a preferred output from R Markdown. However, document formats are often necessary, particularly for term papers, theses/dissertations, and manuscripts for submission to scholarly journals. In this week's lesson, we will focus on the creation of these two output types, including adding bibliographies (which also applies to HTML output), and some basic `ggplot` graphics. 

For both PDF and Word output, much of the structure of your Rmd files will be the same as for HTML output. The major difference is how tables are handled, which we will explore in some detail. Static graphics are handled similarly across all output formats, other than HTML output can support dynamic graphics, such as the Leaflet map we saw in the first lesson, and responsive graphics as in [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).


## Getting US Census data with `tigris`, `tidycensus`
Dealing with US Census data can be overwhelming, particularly if using the raw text-based data. The Census Bureau has an API that allows more streamlined downloads of variables (as data frames) and geographies (as simple format shapes). It is necessary to get an API key, available for free. See [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) and  [tidycensus basic usage](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html).

`tidycensus` uses [`tigris`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tigris/versions/1.0), which downloads the geographic data portion of the census files.

A simple example will download the variables representing the count of White, Black/African American, American Indian/Native American, and Asian persons from the American Community Survey (ACS) data for King County in 2019. For this example to run, you need to have your US Census API key installed, e.g., 

<tt>
tidycensus::census_api_key("*****************", install = TRUE)<br>
<font color="red">
Your API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY").<br>
To use now, restart R or run `readRenviron("~/.Renviron")`
</font>
</tt>

The labels from the census API are:

```
"Estimate!!Total"                                         
"Estimate!!Total!!White alone"                            
"Estimate!!Total!!Black or African American alone"        
"Estimate!!Total!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone"
"Estimate!!Total!!Asian alone" 
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
# the census variables
census_vars <- c(
    p_denom_race = "B02001_001",
    p_n_white = "B02001_002",
    p_n_afram = "B02001_003",
    p_n_aian = "B02001_004",
    p_n_asian = "B02001_005"
)

# get the data
ctdat <- get_acs(
    geography = "tract",
    variables = census_vars,
    cache_table = TRUE,

    output = "wide",
    state = "WA",
    county = "King",
    geometry = TRUE,
    survey = "acs5"
)
```

A few values are shown in Table \@ref(tab:census), and a simple map is shown in \@ref(fig:ct), with percent African American residents and tract identifier.

```{r census}
# print a few records
ctdat %>%
    head() %>%
    kable(caption = "Selected census tract variables from the 5-year ACS from 2019 for King County, WA") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

# Week 4 {#week4}



<h2>Topics: Functions and sampling</h2>
This week's topics are functions and sampling, the latter including a cursory treatment of loops and bootstrapping.

## Environments
Functions exist in `environments`, which are "frames" or collections containing objects including variables, functions, etc.). There is a global environment (`.GlobalEnv`) that contains all of the data, functions, in the current R session. Those objects can be enumerated with the `ls()` function. 

The reason environments are mentioned at this time is because functions instantiate environments that exist while the function is running. More on this in a bit....

## Functions
Functions are sets of statements in R that are grouped together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are either built in, included in packages, or user-defined. Functions are used mainly to simplify running a series of individual commands or functions, for situations where the same process will need to be run multiple times on different inputs, or when control structures are needed (e.g., looping, logical branching).

### Function Components
The different parts of a function are:

1. (Usually) Name: This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in an R environment as an object with this name.
1. (Optional) Arguments: Arguments specify the inputs or options to the function. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.
1. Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.
1. Return value: The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.

Another important concept for functions is environments.

#### Name
Most functions are created with code of the form

```
function_name <- function(argument(s)){
    statement(s)
}
```

For example, to square a vector of numerical values:


```r
f_square <- function(x){
    x^2
}
```

the function name is `f_square`.

Some functions are not named, and are referred to as "anonymous" functions. For example, functions can be used within the `apply` family of functions. Here is an oprationalized example.


```r
# create a list of three vectors of random numbers of different random lengths

# set.seed() makes the random process reproducible.
set.seed(10)
# vector lengths
v.len <- rnorm(n = 3, mean = 30, sd = 10) %>% round(0)

# make the random vectors
set.seed(5)
v1 <- rnorm(n = v.len[1])
set.seed(3)
v2 <- rnorm(n = v.len[2])
set.seed(6)
v3 <- rnorm(n = v.len[3])

# create the list
L <- list(v1, v2, v3)

# get the first value from each vector in the list
lapply(X = L, FUN = function(x) {x[1]})
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] -0.8408555
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] -0.9619334
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 0.269606
```

The last line of the code chunk is:

```
lapply(X = L, FUN = function(x) {x[1]})

```

in which the body of the function is `x[1]`, i.e., obtain the first element of a vector. But the function itself is not named, and hence "anonymous."

#### Arguments
Most functions require arguments. Arguments are used to instantiate variables within the function's environment that can be used later in the body of the function. Each argument is named, and the name is used within the function as a local variable within the function's environment.

Following our example from above, `f_square` takes an argument named "x" that is a numeric vector.

Here, let's modify the function to demonstrate that within the environment of the function, `x` is a variable:


```r
f_square_2 <- function(x){
    message("input:")
    print(x)
    message("output:")
    x^2
}

f_square_2(c(1,2,3))
```

```
## input:
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```
## output:
```

```
## [1] 1 4 9
```

We can try running the function using different (or no) arguments:

Here, using a vector of a single NA numeric


```r
f_square(as.numeric(NA))
```

```
## [1] NA
```

... or a vector that contains a numeric NA:


```r
f_square(c(1, 2, NA))
```

```
## [1]  1  4 NA
```

... or a null:


```r
f_square(NULL)
```

```
## numeric(0)
```

... or a vector containing a null:


```r
f_square(c(1, 2, NULL))
```

```
## [1] 1 4
```

... or with no argument at all:

```
f_square()
```

<font color="red">
```
## Error in f_square() : argument "x" is missing, with no default
```
</font>

Some functions do not require arguments, e.g., to get the current date or time:


```r
Sys.Date()
```

```
## [1] "2022-01-05"
```

```r
Sys.time()
```

```
## [1] "2022-01-05 18:19:56 PST"
```

... and if we try to use an argument we get an error:

```
Sys.Date(1)
```

<font color="red">
```
## Error in Sys.Date(1) : unused argument (1)
```
</font>

##### Default values for arguments
If you want an argument to have a default value, it is specified in the listed arguments in the form `argument = value`. Following our previous `f_square_2()` function, we can modify to print the input based on the logical argument `verbose`:


```r
f_square_3 <- function(x, verbose = FALSE){
    # only run the next lines if verbose is true
    if(verbose){
        message("input:")
        print(x)
        message("output:")
    }
    x^2
}
```

Here we run with the default `verbose` option (`FALSE`):


```r
f_square_3(x = c(1, 2, 3))
```

```
## [1] 1 4 9
```

... and with `verbose = TRUE`:



```r
f_square_3(x = c(1, 2, 3), verbose = TRUE)
```

```
## input:
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

```
## output:
```

```
## [1] 1 4 9
```

A more meaningful example demonstrates stratification of counts into intensity bins using accelerometry data. We will be using accelerometry from one day's data from one subject in a study.

The cut points for accelerometry were identified at 0, 2690, 6167, and 9642 counts per minute, from Sasaki et al. (2011).

__Sasaki JE, John D, Freedson PS. Validation and comparison of ActiGraph activity monitors. J Sci Med Sport. 2011;14(5):411-416. doi:10.1016/j.jsams.2011.04.003__

The variable `vm3` is the vector magnitude measured with the accelerometer for each minute. Data: [accelerometry.csv](files/accelerometry.csv).


```r
acc <- read.csv("files/accelerometry.csv")

head(acc)
```

```
##                 time_acc vm3
## 1 2018-09-13 02:59:00-07   0
## 2 2018-09-13 02:58:00-07   0
## 3 2018-09-13 02:57:00-07   0
## 4 2018-09-13 02:56:00-07   0
## 5 2018-09-13 02:55:00-07   0
## 6 2018-09-13 02:54:00-07   0
```


The following function codes intensity by the aforementioned cut points by default and using default labels:


```r
f_acc_intensity <- function(x, 
                            cuts = c(-Inf, 2690, 6167, 9642, Inf),
                            labels = c("sedentary/low", "moderate", "vigorous", "very vigorous")){
    cut(x = acc$vm3, breaks = cuts, labels = labels)
}
```

... and when run with the defaults to tabulate the minutes spent in different PA levels


```r
acc$intens_default <- f_acc_intensity(acc$vm3)
table(acc$intens_default)
```

```
## 
## sedentary/low      moderate      vigorous very vigorous 
##          1435             4             1             0
```

But we could run this with different thresholds and levels, where SPLA = "sedentary/low physical activity" and MVPA = "moderate-to-very vigorous physical activity):


```r
acc$intens_2lev <- f_acc_intensity(x = acc$vm3,
                                cuts = c(-Inf, 2690, Inf),
                                labels = c("SLPA", "MVVPA"))
table(acc$intens_2lev)
```

```
## 
##  SLPA MVVPA 
##  1435     5
```


##### The `...` argument
When functions do not have a known _a priori_ number or set of arguments, or when a large number of arguments is to be passed to another function the `...` argument is used. We will not cover this but you are encouraged to read more: [How to Use the Dots Argument in R](https://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-use-the-dots-argument-in-r/); [The three-dots construct in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/01/the-three-dots-construct-in-r/).

#### Body
The function's body contains all of the code to perform the purpose of the function. Following our initial example, the body of the function is simply 

```
x^2
```

The body can be as simple or complicated as it needs to be in order to achieve the desired result.

#### Return value
The return value is either the last evaluated expression in the function or an object specified using the `return()` function. 

In our original `f_square()` function, the return value is `x^2` since no other `return()` value was specified, e.g., for a vector of one element:


```r
f_square <- function(x){
    x^2
}
f_square(3)
```

```
## [1] 9
```

or a vector with multiple elements:


```r
f_square(c(1,2,3))
```

```
## [1] 1 4 9
```

An simple example of explicitly specifying return values is shown in this numerical comparison function:


```r
f_compare <- function(x, y){
    # either missing?
    if(nargs() != 2)
        return("invalid number of arguments")
    # numeric?
    if(!is.numeric(x) | !is.numeric(y)){
        return(sprintf("%s or %s is not numeric.", x, y))
    }
    # comparisons follow
    if(x > y){
        return(sprintf("%s is greater than %s", x, y))
    } 
    if(x < y) {
        return(sprintf("%s is less than %s", x, y))
    }
    if(x == y){
        return(sprintf("%s equals %s", x, y))
    }
}
```

If you want to handle an expected error, you can print an informative message and use `return(invisible())`, which returns nothing at all (whereas `return()` results in a `NULL`) e.g., here without `invisible()`:


```r
f_readfile <- function(fname){
    if(!file.exists(fname)){
        warning(paste(fname, "does not exist!"))
        return()
    } else {
        read.csv(fname)
    }
}

f_readfile("foobar.txt")
```

```
## Warning in f_readfile("foobar.txt"): foobar.txt does not exist!
```

```
## NULL
```

... and with `invisible()`:


```r
f_readfile <- function(fname){
    if(!file.exists(fname)){
        warning(paste(fname, "does not exist!"))
        return(invisible())
    } else {
        read.csv(fname)
    }
}

f_readfile("foobar.txt")
```

```
## Warning in f_readfile("foobar.txt"): foobar.txt does not exist!
```


#### Function environments
As mentioned before, functions instantiate environments that exist only while the function is being evaluated. This means that functions can include named variables that have the same name as a variable in a different environment. For example here is a function that only lists what objects are in the local and global environments:


```r
# declare a few variables
x <- 1
y <- "hello"

# a simple function
f <- function(x){
    # create a local variable
    y <- x + 2
    # another function inside this function
    g <- function(x){
        x * 3
    }
    # what variables are in this environment?
    print("----------")
    print("objects in this function's environment:")
    print(ls())
    # what is in the global env?
    print("----------")
    print("objects in the global environment:")
    print(ls(envir = .GlobalEnv))
    # return the output of the function
    print("----------")
    y
}

f(1)
```

```
## [1] "----------"
## [1] "objects in this function's environment:"
## [1] "g" "x" "y"
## [1] "----------"
## [1] "objects in the global environment:"
##  [1] "acc"             "f"               "f_acc_intensity" "f_compare"      
##  [5] "f_readfile"      "f_square"        "f_square_2"      "f_square_3"     
##  [9] "L"               "v.len"           "v1"              "v2"             
## [13] "v3"              "x"               "y"              
## [1] "----------"
```

```
## [1] 3
```

Once the function completes, all objects in its local environment are purged. If you are running a complicated function that creates intermediate values that you want to examine for troubleshooting, this kind of thing can be done, to assign a variable with a specific value to a different environment created specifically for examining the intermediate products of the function:


```r
# create an environment for holding intermediate objects created in the function run
foo <- new.env()
g <- function(x){
    # code for a bunch of complicated operations
    # ...
    # generates an intermediate data frame named "bar"
    bar <- head(iris)
    # save to the other env
    assign(x = "bar", value = bar, envir = foo)
    # more code to do more complicated stuff
    # ...
    foobar <- head(cars)
    # assign this too
    assign(x = "foobar", value = foobar, envir = foo)
    # yet more complicated stuff here
    # ...
}
```

When the function runs, the objects `bar` and `foobar` are placed in the `foo` environment. We can examine those:


```r
# run the function
g()

# what is in environment "foo"?
ls(envir = foo)
```

```
## [1] "bar"    "foobar"
```

And we can view their values:


```r
print(foo$bar)
```

```
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```


```r
print(foo$foobar)
```

```
##   speed dist
## 1     4    2
## 2     4   10
## 3     7    4
## 4     7   22
## 5     8   16
## 6     9   10
```

## Sampling
The general topic of sampling is far greater than what we can cover in this course. However, a few examples may be helpful for students who have little experience in sampling.

The main R function for sampling is `sample()`, which draws a random sample from a vector or data frame. Options for `sample()` include the size of the sample, whether or not to replace sampled individuals to the pool, and a probability weight of the same length (or number of rows) as the population from which the sample is drawn.

### Sampling with replacement
Sampling with replacement is similar to rolling a die. Each roll of the die has a 1/6 probability of coming up with each value. For example:


```r
# create a vector to represent the faces of a die
d <- 1:6

# now make a sample of 100,000 rolls of the die
s <- sample(x = d, size = 100000, replace = TRUE)

# tabulate the result
(tbs <- table(s))
```

```
## s
##     1     2     3     4     5     6 
## 16391 16931 16557 16728 16609 16784
```

```r
# proportions
(prop.table(tbs))
```

```
## s
##       1       2       3       4       5       6 
## 0.16391 0.16931 0.16557 0.16728 0.16609 0.16784
```

The probability of rolling two of the same number in a row is 1/6 $\times$ 1/6, or $\approx$ 0.028

### Sampling without replacement
Sampling without replacement removes from the population the individual that was sampled. For example, the probability of selecting an ace from a whole deck of cards is 4/52, or $\approx$ 0.077. If we drew once from the deck and returned the card back to the deck to draw again, both samples would be independent. The probability of drawing two aces would be 4/52 $\times$ 4/52, or $\approx$ 0.0059. _That_ is an example of sampling _with_ replacement.

Performing the same sample _without_ replacement, i.e., finding an ace, removing it, and then sampling again would have a probability of drawing two aces being 4/52 $\times$ 3/51, or $\approx$ 0.0045.

For a population of sufficient size relative to the sample, sampling with or without replacement will lead to nearly identical results.

Let's use an example of a population of 50,000 persons, where 30,000 are female and 20,000 are male. If we were to sample two persons with replacement, the probability that they would both be female would be 30000/50000 $\times$ 30000/50000, or 0.36.

If we sample without replacement, the probability of selecting a female in the first sample of one would be 30000/50000, and the second sample of 1 would have a probability of selecting a female 29999/49999, with a joint probability of $\approx$ 0.359995.

### Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is used to estimate the characteristics of a population by repeating a large number of random samples (with replacement) and then calculating summary statistics on the set of samples. The reason replacement is used is that each sample represents a "snapshot" of the population. As the number of samples increases, the summary continues to approach the true population characteristics.

We will use a simple example from our previously created hypothetical population. If we had no idea what the male/female split was, we could generate a large number of small-is samples and the take the mean.

Here we will use an R loop. A loop is constructed using the form

```
for (element in set){
    do something
}
```

A few simple examples follow.

Print each letter in the first 5 letters of the alphabet. In this example, the iterated element is a letter. The built in vector `letters` is used:


```r
for (i in head(letters, 5)){
    print(i)
}
```

```
## [1] "a"
## [1] "b"
## [1] "c"
## [1] "d"
## [1] "e"
```

A similar approach, but using a numerical index:


```r
states_5 <- head(state.name, 5)
for (i in 1:length(states_5)){
    s <- states_5[i]
    print(s)
}
```

```
## [1] "Alabama"
## [1] "Alaska"
## [1] "Arizona"
## [1] "Arkansas"
## [1] "California"
```

The bootstrap will use 5,000 samples of size 100 from our hypothetical population to estimate the proportion of females.


```r
# create the population
# 1 indicates female and 0 indicates male
pop <- c(rep(1, 5e4 * 3 / 5), rep(0, 5e4 * 2 / 5))

# initialize a vector
F <- NULL

# run the bootstrap
for (i in seq(from = 1, to = 5000, by = 1)){
    # sample once
    s <- sample(x = pop, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
    # calculate percent female
    p <- sum(s) / length(s)
    # concatenate the result with the running result
    F <- c(F, p)
}

# mean and standard deviation of the bootstrap
mean(F)
```

```
## [1] 0.600582
```

```r
sd(F)
```

```
## [1] 0.04883276
```

Using the bootstrap results, we can estimate the 95% confidence interval around the mean using the `Rmisc::CI()` function, and make a density plot showing the mean and the confidence interval.


```r
# 95% CI
ci_95 <- Rmisc::CI(x = F, ci = 0.95)

# plot with 95 % CI
plot(density(F), main = "density plot of bootstrap")
abline(v = ci_95, col=c(2,1,2))
```

If we already had an enumeration of the population, this method would be unnecessary. However, most survey-derived data are generated from samples. If the sample is representative of the underlying population,  the sample can be considered an acceptable proxy.

<h2>Topics: Functions and sampling</h2>
This week's topics are functions and sampling, the latter including a cursory treatment of loops and bootstrapping.

## Environments
Functions exist in `environments`, which are "frames" or collections containing objects including variables, functions, etc.). There is a global environment (`.GlobalEnv`) that contains all of the data, functions, in the current R session. Those objects can be enumerated with the `ls()` function. 

The reason environments are mentioned at this time is because functions instantiate environments that exist while the function is running. More on this in a bit....

## Functions
Functions are sets of statements in R that are grouped together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are either built in, included in packages, or user-defined. Functions are used mainly to simplify running a series of individual commands or functions, for situations where the same process will need to be run multiple times on different inputs, or when control structures are needed (e.g., looping, logical branching).

### Function Components
The different parts of a function are:

1. (Usually) Name: This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in an R environment as an object with this name.
1. (Optional) Arguments: Arguments specify the inputs or options to the function. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.
1. Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.
1. Return value: The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.

Another important concept for functions is environments.

#### Name
Most functions are created with code of the form

```
function_name <- function(argument(s)){
    statement(s)
}
```

For example, to square a vector of numerical values:

```{r}
f_square <- function(x){
    x^2
}
```

the function name is `f_square`.

Some functions are not named, and are referred to as "anonymous" functions. For example, functions can be used within the `apply` family of functions. Here is an oprationalized example.

```{r}
# create a list of three vectors of random numbers of different random lengths

# set.seed() makes the random process reproducible.
set.seed(10)
# vector lengths
v.len <- rnorm(n = 3, mean = 30, sd = 10) %>% round(0)

# make the random vectors
set.seed(5)
v1 <- rnorm(n = v.len[1])
set.seed(3)
v2 <- rnorm(n = v.len[2])
set.seed(6)
v3 <- rnorm(n = v.len[3])

# create the list
L <- list(v1, v2, v3)

# get the first value from each vector in the list
lapply(X = L, FUN = function(x) {x[1]})
```

The last line of the code chunk is:

```
lapply(X = L, FUN = function(x) {x[1]})

```

in which the body of the function is `x[1]`, i.e., obtain the first element of a vector. But the function itself is not named, and hence "anonymous."

#### Arguments
Most functions require arguments. Arguments are used to instantiate variables within the function's environment that can be used later in the body of the function. Each argument is named, and the name is used within the function as a local variable within the function's environment.

Following our example from above, `f_square` takes an argument named "x" that is a numeric vector.

Here, let's modify the function to demonstrate that within the environment of the function, `x` is a variable:

```{r}
f_square_2 <- function(x){
    message("input:")
    print(x)
    message("output:")
    x^2
}

f_square_2(c(1,2,3))
```

We can try running the function using different (or no) arguments:

Here, using a vector of a single NA numeric

```{r}
f_square(as.numeric(NA))
```

... or a vector that contains a numeric NA:

```{r}
f_square(c(1, 2, NA))
```

... or a null:

```{r}
f_square(NULL)
```

... or a vector containing a null:

```{r}
f_square(c(1, 2, NULL))
```

... or with no argument at all:

```
f_square()
```

<font color="red">
```
## Error in f_square() : argument "x" is missing, with no default
```
</font>

Some functions do not require arguments, e.g., to get the current date or time:

```{r}
Sys.Date()
Sys.time()
```

... and if we try to use an argument we get an error:

```
Sys.Date(1)
```

<font color="red">
```
## Error in Sys.Date(1) : unused argument (1)
```
</font>

##### Default values for arguments
If you want an argument to have a default value, it is specified in the listed arguments in the form `argument = value`. Following our previous `f_square_2()` function, we can modify to print the input based on the logical argument `verbose`:

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
f_square_3 <- function(x, verbose = FALSE){
    # only run the next lines if verbose is true
    if(verbose){
        message("input:")
        print(x)
        message("output:")
    }
    x^2
}
```

Here we run with the default `verbose` option (`FALSE`):

```{r}
f_square_3(x = c(1, 2, 3))
```

... and with `verbose = TRUE`:

```{r}
f_square_3(x = c(1, 2, 3), verbose = TRUE)
```

A more meaningful example demonstrates stratification of counts into intensity bins using accelerometry data. We will be using accelerometry from one day's data from one subject in a study.

The cut points for accelerometry were identified at 0, 2690, 6167, and 9642 counts per minute, from Sasaki et al. (2011).

__Sasaki JE, John D, Freedson PS. Validation and comparison of ActiGraph activity monitors. J Sci Med Sport. 2011;14(5):411-416. doi:10.1016/j.jsams.2011.04.003__

The variable `vm3` is the vector magnitude measured with the accelerometer for each minute. Data: [accelerometry.csv](files/accelerometry.csv).

```{r}
acc <- read.csv("files/accelerometry.csv")

head(acc)
```


The following function codes intensity by the aforementioned cut points by default and using default labels:

```{r}
f_acc_intensity <- function(x, 
                            cuts = c(-Inf, 2690, 6167, 9642, Inf),
                            labels = c("sedentary/low", "moderate", "vigorous", "very vigorous")){
    cut(x = acc$vm3, breaks = cuts, labels = labels)
}
```

... and when run with the defaults to tabulate the minutes spent in different PA levels

```{r}
acc$intens_default <- f_acc_intensity(acc$vm3)
table(acc$intens_default)
```

But we could run this with different thresholds and levels, where SPLA = "sedentary/low physical activity" and MVPA = "moderate-to-very vigorous physical activity):

```{r}
acc$intens_2lev <- f_acc_intensity(x = acc$vm3,
                                cuts = c(-Inf, 2690, Inf),
                                labels = c("SLPA", "MVVPA"))
table(acc$intens_2lev)
```


##### The `...` argument
When functions do not have a known _a priori_ number or set of arguments, or when a large number of arguments is to be passed to another function the `...` argument is used. We will not cover this but you are encouraged to read more: [How to Use the Dots Argument in R](https://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-use-the-dots-argument-in-r/); [The three-dots construct in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/01/the-three-dots-construct-in-r/).

#### Body
The function's body contains all of the code to perform the purpose of the function. Following our initial example, the body of the function is simply 

```
x^2
```

The body can be as simple or complicated as it needs to be in order to achieve the desired result.

#### Return value
The return value is either the last evaluated expression in the function or an object specified using the `return()` function. 

In our original `f_square()` function, the return value is `x^2` since no other `return()` value was specified, e.g., for a vector of one element:

```{r}
f_square <- function(x){
    x^2
}
f_square(3)
```

or a vector with multiple elements:

```{r}
f_square(c(1,2,3))
```

An simple example of explicitly specifying return values is shown in this numerical comparison function:

```{r}
f_compare <- function(x, y){
    # either missing?
    if(nargs() != 2)
        return("invalid number of arguments")
    # numeric?
    if(!is.numeric(x) | !is.numeric(y)){
        return(sprintf("%s or %s is not numeric.", x, y))
    }
    # comparisons follow
    if(x > y){
        return(sprintf("%s is greater than %s", x, y))
    } 
    if(x < y) {
        return(sprintf("%s is less than %s", x, y))
    }
    if(x == y){
        return(sprintf("%s equals %s", x, y))
    }
}
```

If you want to handle an expected error, you can print an informative message and use `return(invisible())`, which returns nothing at all (whereas `return()` results in a `NULL`) e.g., here without `invisible()`:

```{r}
f_readfile <- function(fname){
    if(!file.exists(fname)){
        warning(paste(fname, "does not exist!"))
        return()
    } else {
        read.csv(fname)
    }
}

f_readfile("foobar.txt")
```

... and with `invisible()`:

```{r}
f_readfile <- function(fname){
    if(!file.exists(fname)){
        warning(paste(fname, "does not exist!"))
        return(invisible())
    } else {
        read.csv(fname)
    }
}

f_readfile("foobar.txt")
```


#### Function environments
As mentioned before, functions instantiate environments that exist only while the function is being evaluated. This means that functions can include named variables that have the same name as a variable in a different environment. For example here is a function that only lists what objects are in the local and global environments:

```{r}
# declare a few variables
x <- 1
y <- "hello"

# a simple function
f <- function(x){
    # create a local variable
    y <- x + 2
    # another function inside this function
    g <- function(x){
        x * 3
    }
    # what variables are in this environment?
    print("----------")
    print("objects in this function's environment:")
    print(ls())
    # what is in the global env?
    print("----------")
    print("objects in the global environment:")
    print(ls(envir = .GlobalEnv))
    # return the output of the function
    print("----------")
    y
}

f(1)
```

Once the function completes, all objects in its local environment are purged. If you are running a complicated function that creates intermediate values that you want to examine for troubleshooting, this kind of thing can be done, to assign a variable with a specific value to a different environment created specifically for examining the intermediate products of the function:

```{r}
# create an environment for holding intermediate objects created in the function run
foo <- new.env()
g <- function(x){
    # code for a bunch of complicated operations
    # ...
    # generates an intermediate data frame named "bar"
    bar <- head(iris)
    # save to the other env
    assign(x = "bar", value = bar, envir = foo)
    # more code to do more complicated stuff
    # ...
    foobar <- head(cars)
    # assign this too
    assign(x = "foobar", value = foobar, envir = foo)
    # yet more complicated stuff here
    # ...
}
```

When the function runs, the objects `bar` and `foobar` are placed in the `foo` environment. We can examine those:

```{r}
# run the function
g()

# what is in environment "foo"?
ls(envir = foo)
```

And we can view their values:

```{r}
print(foo$bar)
```

```{r}
print(foo$foobar)
```

## Sampling
The general topic of sampling is far greater than what we can cover in this course. However, a few examples may be helpful for students who have little experience in sampling.

The main R function for sampling is `sample()`, which draws a random sample from a vector or data frame. Options for `sample()` include the size of the sample, whether or not to replace sampled individuals to the pool, and a probability weight of the same length (or number of rows) as the population from which the sample is drawn.

### Sampling with replacement
Sampling with replacement is similar to rolling a die. Each roll of the die has a 1/6 probability of coming up with each value. For example:

```{r}
# create a vector to represent the faces of a die
d <- 1:6

# now make a sample of 100,000 rolls of the die
s <- sample(x = d, size = 100000, replace = TRUE)

# tabulate the result
(tbs <- table(s))

# proportions
(prop.table(tbs))
```

The probability of rolling two of the same number in a row is 1/6 $\times$ 1/6, or $\approx$ 0.028

### Sampling without replacement
Sampling without replacement removes from the population the individual that was sampled. For example, the probability of selecting an ace from a whole deck of cards is 4/52, or $\approx$ 0.077. If we drew once from the deck and returned the card back to the deck to draw again, both samples would be independent. The probability of drawing two aces would be 4/52 $\times$ 4/52, or $\approx$ 0.0059. _That_ is an example of sampling _with_ replacement.

Performing the same sample _without_ replacement, i.e., finding an ace, removing it, and then sampling again would have a probability of drawing two aces being 4/52 $\times$ 3/51, or $\approx$ 0.0045.

For a population of sufficient size relative to the sample, sampling with or without replacement will lead to nearly identical results.

Let's use an example of a population of 50,000 persons, where 30,000 are female and 20,000 are male. If we were to sample two persons with replacement, the probability that they would both be female would be 30000/50000 $\times$ 30000/50000, or 0.36.

If we sample without replacement, the probability of selecting a female in the first sample of one would be 30000/50000, and the second sample of 1 would have a probability of selecting a female 29999/49999, with a joint probability of $\approx$ 0.359995.

### Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is used to estimate the characteristics of a population by repeating a large number of random samples (with replacement) and then calculating summary statistics on the set of samples. The reason replacement is used is that each sample represents a "snapshot" of the population. As the number of samples increases, the summary continues to approach the true population characteristics.

We will use a simple example from our previously created hypothetical population. If we had no idea what the male/female split was, we could generate a large number of small-is samples and the take the mean.

Here we will use an R loop. A loop is constructed using the form

```
for (element in set){
    do something
}
```

A few simple examples follow.

Print each letter in the first 5 letters of the alphabet. In this example, the iterated element is a letter. The built in vector `letters` is used:

```{r}
for (i in head(letters, 5)){
    print(i)
}
```

A similar approach, but using a numerical index:

```{r}
states_5 <- head(state.name, 5)
for (i in 1:length(states_5)){
    s <- states_5[i]
    print(s)
}
```

The bootstrap will use 5,000 samples of size 100 from our hypothetical population to estimate the proportion of females.

```{r}
# create the population
# 1 indicates female and 0 indicates male
pop <- c(rep(1, 5e4 * 3 / 5), rep(0, 5e4 * 2 / 5))

# initialize a vector
F <- NULL

# run the bootstrap
for (i in seq(from = 1, to = 5000, by = 1)){
    # sample once
    s <- sample(x = pop, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
    # calculate percent female
    p <- sum(s) / length(s)
    # concatenate the result with the running result
    F <- c(F, p)
}

# mean and standard deviation of the bootstrap
mean(F)
sd(F)
```

Using the bootstrap results, we can estimate the 95% confidence interval around the mean using the `Rmisc::CI()` function, and make a density plot showing the mean and the confidence interval.

```{r}
# 95% CI
ci_95 <- Rmisc::CI(x = F, ci = 0.95)

# plot with 95 % CI
plot(density(F), main = "density plot of bootstrap")
abline(v = ci_95, col=c(2,1,2))
```

If we already had an enumeration of the population, this method would be unnecessary. However, most survey-derived data are generated from samples. If the sample is representative of the underlying population,  the sample can be considered an acceptable proxy.

# Week 5 {#week5}



<h2>Topic: Git</h2>
This week's topic is a brief introduction to [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the free and open source version control system for text-based files. Much of the material in this lesson is derived from the [Software Carpentry Git tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

## Why use version control?
Version control is simply having control over various versions of your documents. In the context of code-based research using text files such as `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.tex`, `.sql`, `.do`, at the simplest level, version control means having the ability to track changes to your files. In more advanced levels, you should be able to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others and know who did what and when, or to merge together edits made by more than one person

We covered one form of version control in a previous assignment and in the section of this document on [File systems](#file-systems). The version control system was simply keeping copies of existing files and naming new files according to a temporal sequence, with date being the suggested method of nomenclature.

While keeping backup, dated copies of files is not necessarily a bad approach, it suffers from a few major limitations, including:

1. because it relies on saving different versions of a file, it can lead to a proliferation of files
1. it is not often easy to know what changes were made from version to version

Jorge Cham's ([Piled Higher and Deeper](http://www.phdcomics.com)) comic points out what happens to a typical graduate student's "final" version:

[![](images/week05/phd101212s.png)](http://www.phdcomics.com)

## Why use Git?
Version controls systems have been in use since the early 1980s. Commonly used applications are RCS, CVS, SVN, and Subversion. However, some of these require centralized servers, are limited in their capabilities, and are not free.

Git has multiple advantages:

* free
* supports complex work flows with branching, merging, etc., allowing multiple collaborators to work on the same set of files at the same time
* does not require a centralized server (version control can be managed completely within a single computer)
    * it is possible to use online repositories, such as github.com
* can be used within RStudio
* has a large community of users (i.e., free advice)

## Limitations of version control systems
Although version control systems are quite useful, there are some potential drawbacks.

1. requires learning yet another somewhat-complicated system
1. requires mindfulness
    * recorded changes are best performed interactively
    * can only "undo" changes that were committed
1. designed for text files; cannot deal with binary files, e.g., Word or other formats

## A brief Git tutorial
Here we will be using the basic functions of Git while building up an Rmd file.

### Setting up Git in RStudio
We will be working on CSDE Terminal Server 4 (see [Getting started on Terminal Server 4](#getting-started-on-terminal-server-4)). 

Start RStudio and open a web browser.

### Creating a repository
Using the web browser, go to [github.com](http://github.com) and create a repository named `git_r`.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_21_47.png)

Make the repository public and add a README file.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_37_13.png)

Switch back to RStudio and select `File > New Project` and in the choice of project types, select `Version Control`. This will streamline the process of linking the RStudio project with github.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_39_10.png)

Choose `Git` as the type of version control.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_39_46.png)

Enter the complete URL of your new Git repository. The project directly name should automatically be set as the base name pf the URL. If not, enter `git_r`.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_52_48.png)

Because we need to define where on the local file system the project files will be stored, click `Browse` and navigate to your `H:` drive (note that this is your UDrive).

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_53_32.png)

After you have specified the repository URL, project directory name, and parent directory of the project directory, click `Create Project`.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_54_04.png)

### Tracking changes
One of the files we will change is [week_01.Rmd](files/week_01.Rmd), so download this to the main folder of your project.

The first file we will make changes to is `README.md`.

Add some text explaining what purpose the repository serves.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_09_11.png)

Save the changes to the README.md file. If you do not see updates in the Git tab, click the `Refresh listing` button. You may need to do this frequently if your file changes are frequent. Note the status of files will only change when the files are saved.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_37_42.png)

You should see a blue "M" next to the README.md file. Click the check box for `Staged` to prepare to commit the changes to the file and prepare to push to the remote server.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_11_45.png)

Click `Commit` and a new window will open. Any deletions are shown with a light red background. Additions are shown with a light green background, and text that has not changed will have a white background.

Enter some explanatory text in the `Commit message` panel. This message will help identify historical commits. The explanatory text should succinctly describe any changes you have made.

The idea is to make commits each time you have substantially changed your code. If you wait too long between commits, the number of changes in a single commit may be unmanageable. But if commits are made too frequently, the number of commits may become unmanageable. Think of this similarly to how often you might make a new version of a document.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_15_28.png)

Next, we will perform an initial pull/push. It is recommended in multi-user environments to perform a pull from the online repository before pushing. This lets you download to your local file system any files that have been updated by others.

In the Git tab, click the `Pull` icon.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_17_19.png)


Since no changes have been made to the online files, we see the message "Already up to date".

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_17_41.png)

Next, click the `Push` icon to upload any changed files.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_17_58.png)

At some point in the process of establishing the connection to github, you may get some popups asking you to sign in. If this happens, proceed with the authorization.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_19_18.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_19_59.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_20_08.png)

When the authorization is completed, the push will proceed. Your screen will look different, but the last line of text here shows a truncated version of the unique hash (identifier) of the push transaction. This has will allow you to download previous versions of the file in case you made commits and pushes that caused unintended consequences.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_20_32.png)

If you refresh the page for your repository, you should see the updates you made to the README.md file. This is the basic process for updating files, committing changes, and pushing to github.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_21_18.png)


Perform the same steps (click `Staged` then `Commit` for week_01.Rmd). Because this is a new file that was not in the github repository, when it is committed, it will show in all green since all of the text has been added. 

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_46_24.png)

Repeat the pull/push cycle and then refresh your browser to show that the file was added to the online github repository.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_48_45.png)

If you click the file name you will see the contents.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_49_07.png)

Let's make some changes to this file. Back in RStudio, add to the list of packages to load at line 51.

```
library(htmltools) # popup on Leaflet map
```

Change the description at line 122 to read 

```
... for a Leaflet map that has the Space Needle, Savery Hall, and the Woodland Park Zoo.
```

and change the code chunk to add two additional points and text popups for the point markers. The chunk should contain the following code:

```
# the Space Needle
snxy <- data.frame(name = "Space Needle", x = -122.3493, y = 47.6205)
space_needle <- st_as_sf(snxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# Savery Hall
shxy <- data.frame(name = "Savery Hall", x = -122.3083, y = 47.6572)
savery_hall <- st_as_sf(shxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# the Woodland Park Zoo
zooxy <- data.frame(name = "Woodland Park Zoo", x = -122.3543, y = 47.6685)
wp_zoo <- st_as_sf(zooxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# rbind() to put two points in one data frame
pts <- rbind(space_needle, savery_hall, wp_zoo)

# a leaflet
m <- leaflet() %>% 
    addTiles() %>% 
    addCircleMarkers(data = pts, label = ~htmlEscape(name))
m
```

Save the edits to the file and then tap the "knit" button or enter at the console prompt `rmarkdown::render("week_01.Rmd")` to generate the HTML file. You should see that now there are three point markers, and if you hover over any of the markers you will see the name popup.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_32_50.png)

### Git bash shell

Another interface you can use is the Git bash shell. To open the shell, click `Tools > Shell`. 

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_01_34.png) 

All of the GUI commands we have used in RStudio are available in the shell. In fact, very little of the functionality of Git is available within RStudio. To take full advantage of Git, it is necessary to use the shell. There are a number of excellent tutorials on the use of the shell. For now because this is an introductory lesson, we will focus mainly on the RStudio interface,

The shell should be set to the project folder; if not you can enter e.g., `cd /H/git_r` (note that this corresponds to the Windows folder `H:\git_r`).

At the prompt, enter `git status`. This will show the status of all files, in this case showing that `week_01.Rmd` has been modified, and that there are some files that are not being tracked.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_36_02.png)

### Ignoring specific files
Sometimes we are not interested in particular files being committed or pushed to the repository. For version control, we are interested in managing the code that is used to create outputs rather than the outputs themselves, with the idea being that if you have the code, you can recreate any outputs.

So there are files that can be ignored, which are specified in the `.gitignore` file. Open the file and add the line `*.html`. This tells Git not to bother managing HTML files (under the assumption that these are the output of rendering Rmd files).

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_40_15.png)

Save the `.gitignore` file and re-run `git status` at the shell (by tapping the up arrow key on your keyboard and tapping Enter). You should see that the HTML file does not show up in the list of changed or untracked files.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_42_51.png)

Add the line `*.Rproj` to the `.gitignore` file--this file should not be necessary in the repository.

Likewise, if you refresh the Git tab in RStudio, the HTML file is no longer listed.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_43_13.png)

We will perform a few more tasks with the shell. Enter `add .gitignore` and `add week_01.Rmd`. This is the equivalent of clicking the `Staged` check box 

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_45_14.png)

Refreshing the Git tab will show that these two files are staged.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_45_37.png)


### Exploring file change history
Click `Commit` to prepare to commit the changes (addition of `.gitignore` and the changes to `week_01.Rmd`).

As previously mentioned, deleted lines are shown in light red, added lines in light green, and unchanged lines with no highlighting. Click the entry for `week_01.Rmd` and the changes are apparent. Line numbers on the far left are the original line numbers. The next column to the right shows updated line numbers.

This allows you to compare the currently saved version against the previous version of the file.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_48_02.png)

Committing changes with the shell is done by entering 

`
git commit -m "somecomment"
`

This has the same effect as clicking `Commit` in RStudio and entering the comment.

Note that if we have not made some initial user configurations, Git will print some informative text about your identity. To avoid this and to tag future commits, use the `git config --global` commands, e.g., 

`
git config --global user.name "My Full Name"
git config --global user.email "myemailaddress@mydomain"
`

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_51_55.png)

Once the commit is performed, either with the RStudio GUI or with the shell, you can verify that no files are listed to be possibly staged.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_53_10.png)

Perform another pull/push cycle and then refresh your web browser. Click on the commit comment.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_10_46.png)

You will see the changes to the two files in the last commit/push. The `.gitignore` file has all of its lines in green, indicating they are all new with respect to the repository. The file `week_01.Rmd` shows the same changes on github as we saw in the local view before pushing the commit to the server.


![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_12_20.png)

### Restoring a previous version
What good are all of these tracked changes if we cannot revert to a previous version of a file? Here we will make some intentional bad edits to a file, commit and push, but then retrieve a previous version of the file. Any version can be recovered. Note that this does not mean you can recover any and all edits to a file. It only means you can recover what changed between commits. For example, if I made a commit/push at noon, then made a lot of changes and saved the file multiple times before 5 PM and then made a commit/push, there would only be two versions of the file available. For this reason it is worth making commit/push cycles every time you thing you might want to revert to a previous version.

The intentional bad change to `week_01.Rmd` is the complete removal of the code that produces the Leaflet map. See the following image.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_13_13.png)

Perform the standard cycle: stage, commit (with comment), pull, push.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_14_07.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_14_24.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_16_23.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_17_10.png)

You should see the large swath of deleted lines

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_21_01.png)


![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_22_10.png)

Back in the github, find and click the file name.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_24_21.png)

The file contents will show the most recent saved version (missing the Leaflet map lines). Click on the `History` link, which will show all of the commits.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_25_05.png)

Click the commit where you followed the questionable advice from your adviser.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_25_23.png)

The missing lines are evident. What we would like to do is to go back to the version before the large deletion of lines.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_25_40.png)

Identify the previous commit and click the clipboard icon to the left of the first characters of the commit hash. This will copy the hash, which is necessary for restoring that version.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_39_46.png)

Back in the shell, enter

```
git show *****:week_01.Rmd
```

where `*****` is the hash.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_40_36.png)

You will see the text that was present at that commit, which includes the deleted Leaflet map.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_40_59.png)

To restore this previous version to a new file, enter

```
git show *****:week_01.Rmd > week_01_someadditionaldescription.Rmd
```

This prints the contents of the previously committed file and redirects the output to the named file after the `>` sign.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_45_16.png)

If you open that file, you will see the restored text.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_46_04.png)

## Conclusion
This was a brief introduction to the main functionality of Git with RStudio and github. If you expect to perform even a modest amount of coding, you could benefit from Git as a way to keep track of your work, collaborate with others, and avoid programming disasters due to inadvertent deletion of overwriting of files.

<h2>Topic: Git</h2>
This week's topic is a brief introduction to [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the free and open source version control system for text-based files. Much of the material in this lesson is derived from the [Software Carpentry Git tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

## Why use version control?
Version control is simply having control over various versions of your documents. In the context of code-based research using text files such as `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.tex`, `.sql`, `.do`, at the simplest level, version control means having the ability to track changes to your files. In more advanced levels, you should be able to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others and know who did what and when, or to merge together edits made by more than one person

We covered one form of version control in a previous assignment and in the section of this document on [File systems](#file-systems). The version control system was simply keeping copies of existing files and naming new files according to a temporal sequence, with date being the suggested method of nomenclature.

While keeping backup, dated copies of files is not necessarily a bad approach, it suffers from a few major limitations, including:

1. because it relies on saving different versions of a file, it can lead to a proliferation of files
1. it is not often easy to know what changes were made from version to version

Jorge Cham's ([Piled Higher and Deeper](http://www.phdcomics.com)) comic points out what happens to a typical graduate student's "final" version:

[![](images/week05/phd101212s.png)](http://www.phdcomics.com)

## Why use Git?
Version controls systems have been in use since the early 1980s. Commonly used applications are RCS, CVS, SVN, and Subversion. However, some of these require centralized servers, are limited in their capabilities, and are not free.

Git has multiple advantages:

* free
* supports complex work flows with branching, merging, etc., allowing multiple collaborators to work on the same set of files at the same time
* does not require a centralized server (version control can be managed completely within a single computer)
    * it is possible to use online repositories, such as github.com
* can be used within RStudio
* has a large community of users (i.e., free advice)

## Limitations of version control systems
Although version control systems are quite useful, there are some potential drawbacks.

1. requires learning yet another somewhat-complicated system
1. requires mindfulness
    * recorded changes are best performed interactively
    * can only "undo" changes that were committed
1. designed for text files; cannot deal with binary files, e.g., Word or other formats

## A brief Git tutorial
Here we will be using the basic functions of Git while building up an Rmd file.

### Setting up Git in RStudio
We will be working on CSDE Terminal Server 4 (see [Getting started on Terminal Server 4](#getting-started-on-terminal-server-4)). 

Start RStudio and open a web browser.

### Creating a repository
Using the web browser, go to [github.com](http://github.com) and create a repository named `git_r`.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_21_47.png)

Make the repository public and add a README file.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_37_13.png)

Switch back to RStudio and select `File > New Project` and in the choice of project types, select `Version Control`. This will streamline the process of linking the RStudio project with github.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_39_10.png)

Choose `Git` as the type of version control.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_39_46.png)

Enter the complete URL of your new Git repository. The project directly name should automatically be set as the base name pf the URL. If not, enter `git_r`.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_52_48.png)

Because we need to define where on the local file system the project files will be stored, click `Browse` and navigate to your `H:` drive (note that this is your UDrive).

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_53_32.png)

After you have specified the repository URL, project directory name, and parent directory of the project directory, click `Create Project`.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_21_54_04.png)

### Tracking changes
One of the files we will change is [week_01.Rmd](files/week_01.Rmd), so download this to the main folder of your project.

The first file we will make changes to is `README.md`.

Add some text explaining what purpose the repository serves.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_09_11.png)

Save the changes to the README.md file. If you do not see updates in the Git tab, click the `Refresh listing` button. You may need to do this frequently if your file changes are frequent. Note the status of files will only change when the files are saved.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_37_42.png)

You should see a blue "M" next to the README.md file. Click the check box for `Staged` to prepare to commit the changes to the file and prepare to push to the remote server.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_11_45.png)

Click `Commit` and a new window will open. Any deletions are shown with a light red background. Additions are shown with a light green background, and text that has not changed will have a white background.

Enter some explanatory text in the `Commit message` panel. This message will help identify historical commits. The explanatory text should succinctly describe any changes you have made.

The idea is to make commits each time you have substantially changed your code. If you wait too long between commits, the number of changes in a single commit may be unmanageable. But if commits are made too frequently, the number of commits may become unmanageable. Think of this similarly to how often you might make a new version of a document.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_15_28.png)

Next, we will perform an initial pull/push. It is recommended in multi-user environments to perform a pull from the online repository before pushing. This lets you download to your local file system any files that have been updated by others.

In the Git tab, click the `Pull` icon.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_17_19.png)


Since no changes have been made to the online files, we see the message "Already up to date".

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_17_41.png)

Next, click the `Push` icon to upload any changed files.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_17_58.png)

At some point in the process of establishing the connection to github, you may get some popups asking you to sign in. If this happens, proceed with the authorization.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_19_18.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_19_59.png)

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_20_08.png)

When the authorization is completed, the push will proceed. Your screen will look different, but the last line of text here shows a truncated version of the unique hash (identifier) of the push transaction. This has will allow you to download previous versions of the file in case you made commits and pushes that caused unintended consequences.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_20_32.png)

If you refresh the page for your repository, you should see the updates you made to the README.md file. This is the basic process for updating files, committing changes, and pushing to github.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_21_18.png)


Perform the same steps (click `Staged` then `Commit` for week_01.Rmd). Because this is a new file that was not in the github repository, when it is committed, it will show in all green since all of the text has been added. 

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_46_24.png)

Repeat the pull/push cycle and then refresh your browser to show that the file was added to the online github repository.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_48_45.png)

If you click the file name you will see the contents.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_49_07.png)

Let's make some changes to this file. Back in RStudio, add to the list of packages to load at line 51.

```
library(htmltools) # popup on Leaflet map
```

Change the description at line 122 to read 

```
... for a Leaflet map that has the Space Needle, Savery Hall, and the Woodland Park Zoo.
```

and change the code chunk to add two additional points and text popups for the point markers. The chunk should contain the following code:

```
# the Space Needle
snxy <- data.frame(name = "Space Needle", x = -122.3493, y = 47.6205)
space_needle <- st_as_sf(snxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# Savery Hall
shxy <- data.frame(name = "Savery Hall", x = -122.3083, y = 47.6572)
savery_hall <- st_as_sf(shxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# the Woodland Park Zoo
zooxy <- data.frame(name = "Woodland Park Zoo", x = -122.3543, y = 47.6685)
wp_zoo <- st_as_sf(zooxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# rbind() to put two points in one data frame
pts <- rbind(space_needle, savery_hall, wp_zoo)

# a leaflet
m <- leaflet() %>% 
    addTiles() %>% 
    addCircleMarkers(data = pts, label = ~htmlEscape(name))
m
```

Save the edits to the file and then tap the "knit" button or enter at the console prompt `rmarkdown::render("week_01.Rmd")` to generate the HTML file. You should see that now there are three point markers, and if you hover over any of the markers you will see the name popup.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_32_50.png)

### Git bash shell

Another interface you can use is the Git bash shell. To open the shell, click `Tools > Shell`. 

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_22_01_34.png) 

All of the GUI commands we have used in RStudio are available in the shell. In fact, very little of the functionality of Git is available within RStudio. To take full advantage of Git, it is necessary to use the shell. There are a number of excellent tutorials on the use of the shell. For now because this is an introductory lesson, we will focus mainly on the RStudio interface,

The shell should be set to the project folder; if not you can enter e.g., `cd /H/git_r` (note that this corresponds to the Windows folder `H:\git_r`).

At the prompt, enter `git status`. This will show the status of all files, in this case showing that `week_01.Rmd` has been modified, and that there are some files that are not being tracked.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_36_02.png)

### Ignoring specific files
Sometimes we are not interested in particular files being committed or pushed to the repository. For version control, we are interested in managing the code that is used to create outputs rather than the outputs themselves, with the idea being that if you have the code, you can recreate any outputs.

So there are files that can be ignored, which are specified in the `.gitignore` file. Open the file and add the line `*.html`. This tells Git not to bother managing HTML files (under the assumption that these are the output of rendering Rmd files).

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_40_15.png)

Save the `.gitignore` file and re-run `git status` at the shell (by tapping the up arrow key on your keyboard and tapping Enter). You should see that the HTML file does not show up in the list of changed or untracked files.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_42_51.png)

Add the line `*.Rproj` to the `.gitignore` file--this file should not be necessary in the repository.

Likewise, if you refresh the Git tab in RStudio, the HTML file is no longer listed.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_43_13.png)

We will perform a few more tasks with the shell. Enter `add .gitignore` and `add week_01.Rmd`. This is the equivalent of clicking the `Staged` check box 

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_45_14.png)

Refreshing the Git tab will show that these two files are staged.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_45_37.png)


### Exploring file change history
Click `Commit` to prepare to commit the changes (addition of `.gitignore` and the changes to `week_01.Rmd`).

As previously mentioned, deleted lines are shown in light red, added lines in light green, and unchanged lines with no highlighting. Click the entry for `week_01.Rmd` and the changes are apparent. Line numbers on the far left are the original line numbers. The next column to the right shows updated line numbers.

This allows you to compare the currently saved version against the previous version of the file.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_48_02.png)

Committing changes with the shell is done by entering 

`
git commit -m "somecomment"
`

This has the same effect as clicking `Commit` in RStudio and entering the comment.

Note that if we have not made some initial user configurations, Git will print some informative text about your identity. To avoid this and to tag future commits, use the `git config --global` commands, e.g., 

`
git config --global user.name "My Full Name"
git config --global user.email "myemailaddress@mydomain"
`

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_51_55.png)

Once the commit is performed, either with the RStudio GUI or with the shell, you can verify that no files are listed to be possibly staged.

![](images/week05/2021-02-04_23_53_10.png)

Perform another pull/push cycle and then refresh your web browser. Click on the commit comment.

![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_10_46.png)

You will see the changes to the two files in the last commit/push. The `.gitignore` file has all of its lines in green, indicating they are all new with respect to the repository. The file `week_01.Rmd` shows the same changes on github as we saw in the local view before pushing the commit to the server.


![](images/week05/2021-02-05_00_12_20.png)

### Restoring a previous version
What good are all of these tracked changes if we cannot revert to a previous version of a file? Here we will make some intentional bad edits to a file, commit and push, but then retrieve a previous version of the file. Any version can be recovered.

To restore this previous version to a new file, enter

<h2>Topic: Add Health data: exploring variables and data documentation</h2>

## The Add Health study data
The Add Health [web site](https://data.cpc.unc.edu/projects/2/view) describes the study:

> Initiated in 1994 and supported by five program project grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) with co-funding from 23 other federal agencies and foundations, Add Health is the largest, most comprehensive, nationally-representative longitudinal survey of adolescents ever undertaken. Beginning with an in-school questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7-12, the study followed up with a series of in-home interviews conducted in 1995, 1996, 2001-02, 2008, and 2016-18. Add Health participants are now full-fledged adults, aged 33-44, and will soon be moving into midlife. Over the years, Add Health has added a substantial amount of additional data for users, including contextual data on the communities and states in which participants reside, genomic data and a range of biological health markers of participants, and parental survey data.

The public-use data contain a subset of records and variables from the restricted-use full data set. The full data set requires a lengthy application process and meeting specific security standards. [CSDE](https://csde.washington.edu/) has a copy of most of the tables in the restricted-use data set on the [UW Data Collaborative](https://dcollab.uw.edu/data/add-health/).

We will be using the Wave 1 public-use Add Health data for most of the remainder of the term. This week we will briefly delve into the documentation and see how the data set use is supported by the documentation.

## Documentation
The Add Health data are very well documented. The PDFs contain the verbatim text of the survey questions, the range of encoded answers, and count tabulations of responses.

See the full set of metadata PDFs: [Wave1_InHome_Codebooks](data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks/), and the [comprehensive codebook](data/metadata/Wave1_Comprehensive_Codebook/).

We will revisit the documentation later in this lesson.

## Data sets
The two data sets we will be using are [AHwave1_v1.dta.zip](data/AHwave1_v1.dta.zip) and [21600-0001-Data.dta.zip](data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip). Download each file and unzip them, which will result in `AHwave1_v1.dta`, which we have encountered before, and `21600-0001-Data.dta`.

Both of these are Stata files. Stata files version 12 and below can be read with `foreign::read.dta()`, but version 13 and up require `haven::read_dta()` or `readstata13::read.dta13()`.

One of the benefits of the Stata file formats, as compared to e.g., CSV or Excel, is that the Stata files can contain metadata about the variables. The imported data frames themselves may have cryptic variable names, but more extensive _labels_. The R import process can expose those labels, making the data more easy to interpret

### `AHwave1_v1.dta`
`AHwave1_v1.dta` is a Stata version 13 file. Here we will look at the two import options.

#### `haven::read_dta()`
`haven::read_dta()` will read the data in as a data frame. Note for the code examples to run without modification, the assumption is that the data have been downloaded and unzipped in a sub-folder named `data` within the current working directory. You can find out what the current working directory is by entering `getwd()` at the R prompt.


```r
# read the data
if(!file.exists("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")){
    unzip(zipfile = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta.zip", exdir = "data")
}
AHwave1_v1_haven <- haven::read_dta(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
```

Each labeled variable has attributes can be perused by listing structure:


```r
str(AHwave1_v1_haven$imonth)
```

```

In order to access the metadata as a single object, one can use the `lapply()` function, because the data frame can also be treated as a list. Here, each variable has its name, label, data format, and values extracted to a single data frame and presented as a `DT::datatable`. This provides the metadata in a format that is probably easier to use than the PDF documentation.


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata <- bind_cols(
    # variable name
    varname = colnames(AHwave1_v1_haven),
    # label
    varlabel = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist(),
    # format
    varformat = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$format.stata) %>%
        unlist(),
    # values
    varvalues = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$labels) %>% 
        # names the variable label vector
        lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
        # as character
        as.character() %>% 
        # remove the c() construction
        str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$")
)

DT::datatable(AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata)
```

#### `readstata13::read.dta13()`
`readstata13::read.dta13()` will similarly read the data as a data frame. There are a number of different options for converting factors, so if you are dealing with a lot of Stata files you may want to become familiar with some of these options.

For example, using all default options kicks out some warnings about double precision coding and missing factor labels. _[Note: to hide these warnings, for better or worse (i.e., you might not want to hide them), use the code chunk option `warning=FALSE`]._


```r
# read the data
AHwave1_v1_rs13 <- readstata13::read.dta13(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
```

```
## Warning in readstata13::read.dta13(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta"): 
##    Factor codes of type double or float detected in variables
## 
##    h1hr7a, h1hr7b
## 
##    No labels have been assigned.
##    Set option 'nonint.factors = TRUE' to assign labels anyway.
```

```
## Warning in readstata13::read.dta13(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta"): 
##    Missing factor labels for variables
## 
##    h1hr8e
## 
##    No labels have beend assigned.
##    Set option 'generate.factors=TRUE' to generate labels.
```


```r
# read the data
AHwave1_v1_rs13 <- readstata13::read.dta13(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta", generate.factors = TRUE, nonint.factors = TRUE)
```

Metadata can be generated similarly:


```r
AHwave1_v1_rs13_metadata <- bind_cols(
    varname = colnames(AHwave1_v1_rs13),
    varlabel = attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$var.labels,
    varformat = attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$formats
)

# value ranges; need to do this separately because those variables with no value labels were not accounted for
varvalues <- bind_cols(
    varname = names(attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$label.table) %>% tolower,
    vals = attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$label.table %>% 
    lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
    as.character() %>% 
    str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$"))

# join
AHwave1_v1_rs13_metadata %<>% 
    left_join(varvalues, by = "varname")

DT::datatable(AHwave1_v1_rs13_metadata)
```

The default conversion creates factors, so the tables _may_ be easy to read/interpret ...


```r
head(x = AHwave1_v1_rs13$imonth, n = 6)
```

```
## [1] (6) June (5) May  (6) June (7) July (7) July (6) June
## 10 Levels: (1) January (4) April (5) May (6) June (7) July ... (12) December
```

... but programming will require more work because the factors would either need to be explicitly named, e.g.,


```r
AHwave1_v1_rs13 %>% 
    head(10) %>% 
    filter(imonth == "(6) June") %>% 
    select(aid, imonth, iday)
```

```
##        aid   imonth iday
## 1 57100270 (6) June   23
## 2 57103171 (6) June   27
## 3 57104649 (6) June   12
## 4 57109625 (6) June    7
## 5 57110897 (6) June   27
```

Because the factors are really just labelled numbers, one could use the numeric values, but care needs to be taken:


```r
levels(AHwave1_v1_rs13$imonth) %>% t() %>% t()
```

```
##       [,1]           
##  [1,] "(1) January"  
##  [2,] "(4) April"    
##  [3,] "(5) May"      
##  [4,] "(6) June"     
##  [5,] "(7) July"     
##  [6,] "(8) August"   
##  [7,] "(9) September"
##  [8,] "(10) October" 
##  [9,] "(11) November"
## [10,] "(12) December"
```

Because not all months are represented in the data, the numerical value of the month may not be what you expect. For example, the 4th month factor level is "(6) June" rather than "(4) April".

Compare this with the results from `haven::read_dta()`. The values are not factors, but labelled double-precision numbers:


```r
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$imonth)
```

```
## <labelled<double>[6]>: MONTH OF INTERVIEW-W1
## [1] 6 5 6 7 7 6
## 
## Labels:
##  value         label
##      1   (1) January
##      4     (4) April
##      5       (5) May
##      6      (6) June
##      7      (7) July
##      8    (8) August
##      9 (9) September
##     10  (10) October
##     11 (11) November
##     12 (12) December
```

To perform a similar `filter()` & `select()` operation with the haven version:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    head(10) %>% 
    filter(imonth == 6) %>% 
    select(aid, imonth, iday)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   aid            imonth  iday
##   <chr>       <dbl+lbl> <dbl>
## 1 57100270 6 [(6) June]    23
## 2 57103171 6 [(6) June]    27
## 3 57104649 6 [(6) June]    12
## 4 57109625 6 [(6) June]     7
## 5 57110897 6 [(6) June]    27
```

### `21600-0001-Data.dta`
`21600-0001-Data.dta` is a much larger data set. It has the same count of records, but more columns than `AHwave1_v1.dta`.


```r
# read in the larger data set
if(!file.exists("data/21600-0001-Data.dta")){
    unzip(zipfile = "data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip", exdir = "data")
}
data_21600_0001 <- haven::read_dta(file = "data/21600-0001-Data.dta")
# if(file.exists("data/21600-0001-Data.dta")){
#     file.remove(file = "data/21600-0001-Data.dta")
# }

# dimensions of the two
dim(AHwave1_v1_haven)
```

```
## [1] 6504  103
```

```r
dim(data_21600_0001)
```

```
## [1] 6504 2794
```

In fact, `AHwave1_v1.dta` seems to be a subset of `21600-0001-Data.dta`. We can show this by lower-casing the column names and then using a `select()` for the same named columns


```r
# lowercase the column names
colnames(data_21600_0001) %<>% str_to_lower()

# select() some columns of the same name
dat <- data_21600_0001 %>% 
    select(colnames(AHwave1_v1_haven))

# identical?
identical(dat, AHwave1_v1_haven)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
# if(file.exists("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")){
#     file.remove("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
# }
```

We can build a similar table of metadata, but this time as a function:


```r
# a generic(?) function to generate metadata for a Stata file read by haven::read_dta()
# x is a haven data frame
f_haven_stata_metadata <- function(x){
    # variable names
    varname <- colnames(x)
    # labels
    varlabel <- x %>% 
        lapply(., function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist()
    # format
    varformat <- x %>% 
        lapply(., function(x) attributes(x)$format.stata) %>%
        unlist()
    # values
    varvalues <- x %>% 
        lapply(., function(x) attributes(x)$labels) %>% 
        # names the variable label vector
        lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
        # as character
        as.character() %>% 
        # remove the c() construction
        str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$")  
    
    bind_cols(varname = varname, 
              varlabel = varlabel, 
              varformat = varformat,
              varvalues = varvalues)
}

# generate the metadata
data_21600_0001_metadata <- f_haven_stata_metadata(data_21600_0001)

# print the metadata table as a DT::datatable
DT::datatable(data_21600_0001_metadata)
```

## Searching through documentation
Good data sets have good documentation. Sometimes the documentation is voluminous, as is the case for the Add Health data. With voluminous metadata, are there good approaches to finding what you are interested in without opening each PDF file, reading the table of contents, searching for string matches, etc.?

This section will cover two tools to make searching through PDF files less onerous and more efficient. The two utilities are `pdfgrep` and `pdftools::pdf_text()`

### `pdfgrep`
`grep` is a string-matching utility developed mainly for UNIX, now available for all common operating systems. It is also implemented in base R with the function `grep()`. The name comes from the ed command g/re/p ($\underline{g}$lobally search for a $\underline{r}$egular $\underline{e}$xpression and $\underline{p}$rint matching lines), typically used to print the line number of a text file containing the search pattern. 

If you are not familiar with regular expressions and you plan on doing computational social sciences, the sooner you learn, the better. See the R help topic for `base::regex()`.

We won't be covering `grep` in general here, but will introduce some of the regular expression logic in `pdfgrep`. 

Start by installing a version of `pdfgrep`. These are three implementations, one for Mac and two for Windows. The demo today will use the Cygwin version. The native Windows version is not as powerful/customizable as the Cygwin version and will also likely be more comparable with the Mac version. ___Note:___ `pdfgrep` will only work on PDF files that contain text. PDFs that are composed solely from scanned images contain no text and are therefore not searchable using regular expressions.

[pdfgrep for native Windows](https://soft.rubypdf.com/software/pdfgrep-windows-version)

[pdfgrep for Cygwin under Windows](https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-cat.cgi?file=x86%2Fpdfgrep%2Fpdfgrep-1.4.1-1&grep=pdfgrep)

[pdfgrep for Mac](http://macappstore.org/pdfgrep/)

A zipped file containing all of the metadata files for the In Home Questionnaire is available as [Wave1_InHome_Codebooks.pdf.zip](data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks.pdf.zip). Download the file and unzip it in an appropriate location.

#### A few use examples
_[Note: the images below may be hard to read; clicking them will open them in full-size; click with the middle mouse button to open in a new tab.]_

Here we will search through the entire set of PDF files for the regular expression `black`. First, let's list the PDF files using

`
ls *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_31_11-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_31_11-_cygdrive_L.png)


The syntax for the search is 

`
pdfgrep black *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_45_41-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_45_41-_cygdrive_L.png)

This prints the file name and the matching text of each PDF containing the regular expression `black`. Suppose we wanted to search for `black` or `Black` or `BLACK`? Use the flag `-i` which is short for case $\underline{i}$nsensitive.

`
pdfgrep -i black *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_06-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_06-_cygdrive_L.png)

This shows all files that contain `black` in any case combination. 

We might want to know where to look (i.e., page number) in the file. Using the `-n` flag prints the page $\underline{n}$umber.

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_38-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_38-_cygdrive_L.png)

Seeing that there are several matches in `inh25pub.pdf`, the first match on page 13, let's view that:

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_22_16_08-inh25pub.pdf.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_22_16_08-inh25pub.pdf.png)

Let's look for another pattern, the word `recreation`:

`
pdfgrep -n -i recreation *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_14-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_14-_cygdrive_L.png)

Seeing the matches, we might want to narrow the search to include only "social or recreation"al activity. Here, the regular expression is `social.*recreation`, where the `.*` regexp translates to "any number of any characters."


[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_34-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_34-_cygdrive_L.png)


We will perform one more pattern match. Suppose we were interested in being tired or stressed. The regexp pattern `"pat1|pat2"` (note the quotes and the vertical bar). The quotes indicate to the shell that [this is not a pipe](#magrittr), but part of the regexp.

Here the full expression to show those metadata files that match either of these patterns.

`
pdfgrep -i "tired|stress" *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_54_04-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_54_04-_cygdrive_L.png)

___Why___, you may ask, if we created those fancy metadata tables from the data, would we want to search for specific strings in the PDF documentation? Because the full documentation is likely to provide more complete explanations, whereas the metadata created from the data labels is only a brief description.

### `pdftools::pdf_text()`
Staying completely within R, we can perform similar searches through PDF files. We start with `pdftools::pdf_text()`, which converts PDFs to text vectors, where each page is converted to one vector element. This can be piped through text-matching functions, such as `base::grep()` or `stringr::str_match()` (`stringr` is loaded by `tidyverse`).

Unlike `pdfgrep`, which can serially search through a set of files in a directory, `pdf_text()` requires additional work. Here is an example that mimics searching for the case-insensitive regular expression `black` in the set of PDFs.

We create a function that searches through a single PDF and then loop the function over the set of PDFs in a specified folder, returning the file name list, the pattern we searched on, the page number with the match, and whether the search was case sensitive or not.


```r
# a function to get matching strings in a PDF, ignore case
f_pdf_str_match <- function(x, pat, ignore.case = TRUE){
    # convert the PDF to text
    mytext <- pdf_text(x)
    # pattern
    if(ignore.case){
        mypat <- regex(pat, ignore_case = TRUE)
    } else {
        mypat <- pat
    }
    # match strings = pages
    pages <- str_which(string = mytext, pattern = mypat)
    if(length(pages) == 0){
        return(data.frame(fname = x, pat, page_num = as.integer(NA), ignore.case))
    }
    # create a data frame
    data.frame(fname = x, pat, page_num = pages, ignore.case)
}

# a list of my PDFs
mypdfs <- list.files(path = "data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks", pattern = "*.pdf$", full.names = TRUE)

# an empty data frame
x <- NULL

# run each one
for(i in mypdfs){
    x <- rbind(x, f_pdf_str_match(i, "black", ignore.case = TRUE))
}

# ignore NAs
x %>% filter(!is.na(page_num))
```

```
##                                               fname   pat page_num ignore.case
## 1 data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks/inh01pub.pdf black        7        TRUE
## 2 data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks/inh01pub.pdf black        9        TRUE
```

## Conclusion
We will use these data sets and metadata for the next several lessons. The methods presented in today's lesson should increase efficiency and reduce busy-work.

<h2>Topic: Add Health data: exploring variables and data documentation</h2>

## The Add Health study data
The Add Health [web site](https://data.cpc.unc.edu/projects/2/view) describes the study:

> Initiated in 1994 and supported by five program project grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) with co-funding from 23 other federal agencies and foundations, Add Health is the largest, most comprehensive, nationally-representative longitudinal survey of adolescents ever undertaken. Beginning with an in-school questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7-12, the study followed up with a series of in-home interviews conducted in 1995, 1996, 2001-02, 2008, and 2016-18. Add Health participants are now full-fledged adults, aged 33-44, and will soon be moving into midlife. Over the years, Add Health has added a substantial amount of additional data for users, including contextual data on the communities and states in which participants reside, genomic data and a range of biological health markers of participants, and parental survey data.

The public-use data contain a subset of records and variables from the restricted-use full data set. The full data set requires a lengthy application process and meeting specific security standards. [CSDE](https://csde.washington.edu/) has a copy of most of the tables in the restricted-use data set on the [UW Data Collaborative](https://dcollab.uw.edu/data/add-health/).

We will be using the Wave 1 public-use Add Health data for most of the remainder of the term. This week we will briefly delve into the documentation and see how the data set use is supported by the documentation.

## Documentation
The Add Health data are very well documented. The PDFs contain the verbatim text of the survey questions, the range of encoded answers, and count tabulations of responses.

See the full set of metadata PDFs: [Wave1_InHome_Codebooks](data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks/), and the [comprehensive codebook](data/metadata/Wave1_Comprehensive_Codebook/).

We will revisit the documentation later in this lesson.

## Data sets
The two data sets we will be using are [AHwave1_v1.dta.zip](data/AHwave1_v1.dta.zip) and [21600-0001-Data.dta.zip](data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip). Download each file and unzip them, which will result in `AHwave1_v1.dta`, which we have encountered before, and `21600-0001-Data.dta`.

Both of these are Stata files. Stata files version 12 and below can be read with `foreign::read.dta()`, but version 13 and up require `haven::read_dta()` or `readstata13::read.dta13()`.

One of the benefits of the Stata file formats, as compared to e.g., CSV or Excel, is that the Stata files can contain metadata about the variables. The imported data frames themselves may have cryptic variable names, but more extensive _labels_. The R import process can expose those labels, making the data more easy to interpret

### `AHwave1_v1.dta`
`AHwave1_v1.dta` is a Stata version 13 file. Here we will look at the two import options.

#### `haven::read_dta()`
`haven::read_dta()` will read the data in as a data frame. Note for the code examples to run without modification, the assumption is that the data have been downloaded and unzipped in a sub-folder named `data` within the current working directory. You can find out what the current working directory is by entering `getwd()` at the R prompt.

```{r}
# read the data
if(!file.exists("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")){
    unzip(zipfile = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta.zip", exdir = "data")
}
AHwave1_v1_haven <- haven::read_dta(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
```

Each labeled variable has attributes can be perused by listing structure:

```{r}
str(AHwave1_v1_haven$imonth)
```

or the first few values (`head()`):

```{r}
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$bio_sex)
```

or listing the attributes of the variable itself, which provides a more verbose listing of the variable label, data format, class, and value labels:

```{r}
attributes(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi1m)
```


In order to access the metadata as a single object, one can use the `lapply()` function, because the data frame can also be treated as a list. Here, each variable has its name, label, data format, and values extracted to a single data frame and presented as a `DT::datatable`. This provides the metadata in a format that is probably easier to use than the PDF documentation.

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata <- bind_cols(
    # variable name
    varname = colnames(AHwave1_v1_haven),
    # label
    varlabel = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist(),
    # format
    varformat = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$format.stata) %>%
        unlist(),
    # values
    varvalues = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$labels) %>% 
        # names the variable label vector
        lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
        # as character
        as.character() %>% 
        # remove the c() construction
        str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$")
)

DT::datatable(AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata)

```

#### `readstata13::read.dta13()`
`readstata13::read.dta13()` will similarly read the data as a data frame. There are a number of different options for converting factors, so if you are dealing with a lot of Stata files you may want to become familiar with some of these options.

For example, using all default options kicks out some warnings about double precision coding and missing factor labels. _[Note: to hide these warnings, for better or worse (i.e., you might not want to hide them), use the code chunk option `warning=FALSE`]._

```{r}
# read the data
AHwave1_v1_rs13 <- readstata13::read.dta13(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
```

```{r}
# read the data
AHwave1_v1_rs13 <- readstata13::read.dta13(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta", generate.factors = TRUE, nonint.factors = TRUE)
```

Metadata can be generated similarly:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_rs13_metadata <- bind_cols(
    varname = colnames(AHwave1_v1_rs13),
    varlabel = attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$var.labels,
    varformat = attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$formats
)

# value ranges; need to do this separately because those variables with no value labels were not accounted for
varvalues <- bind_cols(
    varname = names(attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$label.table) %>% tolower,
    vals = attributes(AHwave1_v1_rs13)$label.table %>% 
    lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
    as.character() %>% 
    str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$"))

# join
AHwave1_v1_rs13_metadata %<>% 
    left_join(varvalues, by = "varname")

DT::datatable(AHwave1_v1_rs13_metadata)
```

The default conversion creates factors, so the tables _may_ be easy to read/interpret ...

```{r}
head(x = AHwave1_v1_rs13$imonth, n = 6)
```

... but programming will require more work because the factors would either need to be explicitly named, e.g.,

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_rs13 %>% 
    head(10) %>% 
    filter(imonth == "(6) June") %>% 
    select(aid, imonth, iday)
```

Because the factors are really just labelled numbers, one could use the numeric values, but care needs to be taken:

```{r}
levels(AHwave1_v1_rs13$imonth) %>% t() %>% t()
```

Because not all months are represented in the data, the numerical value of the month may not be what you expect. For example, the 4th month factor level is "(6) June" rather than "(4) April".

Compare this with the results from `haven::read_dta()`. The values are not factors, but labelled double-precision numbers:

```{r}
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$imonth)
```

To perform a similar `filter()` & `select()` operation with the haven version:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    head(10) %>% 
    filter(imonth == 6) %>% 
    select(aid, imonth, iday)
```

___Which approach do you prefer?___

### `21600-0001-Data.dta`
`21600-0001-Data.dta` is a much larger data set. It has the same count of records, but more columns than `AHwave1_v1.dta`.

```{r}
# read in the larger data set
if(!file.exists("data/21600-0001-Data.dta")){
    unzip(zipfile = "data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip", exdir = "data")
}
data_21600_0001 <- haven::read_dta(file = "data/21600-0001-Data.dta")
# if(file.exists("data/21600-0001-Data.dta")){
#     file.remove(file = "data/21600-0001-Data.dta")
# }

# dimensions of the two
dim(AHwave1_v1_haven)
dim(data_21600_0001)
```

In fact, `AHwave1_v1.dta` seems to be a subset of `21600-0001-Data.dta`. We can show this by lower-casing the column names and then using a `select()` for the same named columns

```{r}
# lowercase the column names
colnames(data_21600_0001) %<>% str_to_lower()

# select() some columns of the same name
dat <- data_21600_0001 %>% 
    select(colnames(AHwave1_v1_haven))

# identical?
identical(dat, AHwave1_v1_haven)
# if(file.exists("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")){
#     file.remove("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
# }
```

We can build a similar table of metadata, but this time as a function:

```{r}
# a generic(?) function to generate metadata for a Stata file read by haven::read_dta()
# x is a haven data frame
f_haven_stata_metadata <- function(x){
    # variable names
    varname <- colnames(x)
    # labels
    varlabel <- x %>% 
        lapply(., function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist()
    # format
    varformat <- x %>% 
        lapply(., function(x) attributes(x)$format.stata) %>%
        unlist()
    # values
    varvalues <- x %>% 
        lapply(., function(x) attributes(x)$labels) %>% 
        # names the variable label vector
        lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
        # as character
        as.character() %>% 
        # remove the c() construction
        str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$")  
    
    bind_cols(varname = varname, 
              varlabel = varlabel, 
              varformat = varformat,
              varvalues = varvalues)
}

# generate the metadata
data_21600_0001_metadata <- f_haven_stata_metadata(data_21600_0001)

# print the metadata table as a DT::datatable
DT::datatable(data_21600_0001_metadata)

```

## Searching through documentation
Good data sets have good documentation. Sometimes the documentation is voluminous, as is the case for the Add Health data. With voluminous metadata, are there good approaches to finding what you are interested in without opening each PDF file, reading the table of contents, searching for string matches, etc.?

This section will cover two tools to make searching through PDF files less onerous and more efficient. The two utilities are `pdfgrep` and `pdftools::pdf_text()`

### `pdfgrep`
`grep` is a string-matching utility developed mainly for UNIX, now available for all common operating systems. It is also implemented in base R with the function `grep()`. The name comes from the ed command g/re/p ($\underline{g}$lobally search for a $\underline{r}$egular $\underline{e}$xpression and $\underline{p}$rint matching lines), typically used to print the line number of a text file containing the search pattern. 

If you are not familiar with regular expressions and you plan on doing computational social sciences, the sooner you learn, the better. See the R help topic for `base::regex()`.

We won't be covering `grep` in general here, but will introduce some of the regular expression logic in `pdfgrep`. 

Start by installing a version of `pdfgrep`. These are three implementations, one for Mac and two for Windows. The demo today will use the Cygwin version. The native Windows version is not as powerful/customizable as the Cygwin version and will also likely be more comparable with the Mac version. ___Note:___ `pdfgrep` will only work on PDF files that contain text. PDFs that are composed solely from scanned images contain no text and are therefore not searchable using regular expressions.

[pdfgrep for native Windows](https://soft.rubypdf.com/software/pdfgrep-windows-version)

[pdfgrep for Cygwin under Windows](https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-cat.cgi?file=x86%2Fpdfgrep%2Fpdfgrep-1.4.1-1&grep=pdfgrep)

[pdfgrep for Mac](http://macappstore.org/pdfgrep/)

A zipped file containing all of the metadata files for the In Home Questionnaire is available as [Wave1_InHome_Codebooks.pdf.zip](data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks.pdf.zip). Download the file and unzip it in an appropriate location.

#### A few use examples
_[Note: the images below may be hard to read; clicking them will open them in full-size; click with the middle mouse button to open in a new tab.]_

Here we will search through the entire set of PDF files for the regular expression `black`. First, let's list the PDF files using

`
ls *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_31_11-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_31_11-_cygdrive_L.png)


The syntax for the search is 

`
pdfgrep black *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_45_41-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_45_41-_cygdrive_L.png)

This prints the file name and the matching text of each PDF containing the regular expression `black`. Suppose we wanted to search for `black` or `Black` or `BLACK`? Use the flag `-i` which is short for case $\underline{i}$nsensitive.

`
pdfgrep -i black *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_06-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_06-_cygdrive_L.png)

This shows all files that contain `black` in any case combination. 

We might want to know where to look (i.e., page number) in the file. Using the `-n` flag prints the page $\underline{n}$umber.

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_38-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_47_38-_cygdrive_L.png)

Seeing that there are several matches in `inh25pub.pdf`, the first match on page 13, let's view that:

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_22_16_08-inh25pub.pdf.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_22_16_08-inh25pub.pdf.png)

Let's look for another pattern, the word `recreation`:

`
pdfgrep -n -i recreation *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_14-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_14-_cygdrive_L.png)

Seeing the matches, we might want to narrow the search to include only "social or recreation"al activity. Here, the regular expression is `social.*recreation`, where the `.*` regexp translates to "any number of any characters."


[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_34-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_48_34-_cygdrive_L.png)


We will perform one more pattern match. Suppose we were interested in being tired or stressed. The regexp pattern `"pat1|pat2"` (note the quotes and the vertical bar). The quotes indicate to the shell that [this is not a pipe](#magrittr), but part of the regexp.

Here the full expression to show those metadata files that match either of these patterns.

`
pdfgrep -i "tired|stress" *.pdf
`

[![](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_54_04-_cygdrive_L.png)](images/week06/2021-02-11_21_54_04-_cygdrive_L.png)

___Why___, you may ask, if we created those fancy metadata tables from the data, would we want to search for specific strings in the PDF documentation? Because the full documentation is likely to provide more complete explanations, whereas the metadata created from the data labels is only a brief description.

### `pdftools::pdf_text()`
Staying completely within R, we can perform similar searches through PDF files. We start with `pdftools::pdf_text()`, which converts PDFs to text vectors, where each page is converted to one vector element. This can be piped through text-matching functions, such as `base::grep()` or `stringr::str_match()` (`stringr` is loaded by `tidyverse`).

Unlike `pdfgrep`, which can serially search through a set of files in a directory, `pdf_text()` requires additional work. Here is an example that mimics searching for the case-insensitive regular expression `black` in the set of PDFs.

We create a function that searches through a single PDF and then loop the function over the set of PDFs in a specified folder, returning the file name list, the pattern we searched on, the page number with the match, and whether the search was case sensitive or not.

```{r}
# a function to get matching strings in a PDF, ignore case
f_pdf_str_match <- function(x, pat, ignore.case = TRUE){
    # convert the PDF to text
    mytext <- pdf_text(x)
    # pattern
    if(ignore.case){
        mypat <- regex(pat, ignore_case = TRUE)
    } else {
        mypat <- pat
    }
    # match strings = pages
    pages <- str_which(string = mytext, pattern = mypat)
    if(length(pages) == 0){
        return(data.frame(fname = x, pat, page_num = as.integer(NA), ignore.case))
    }
    # create a data frame
    data.frame(fname = x, pat, page_num = pages, ignore.case)
}

# a list of my PDFs
mypdfs <- list.files(path = "data/metadata/Wave1_InHome_Codebooks", pattern = "*.pdf$", full.names = TRUE)

# an empty data frame
x <- NULL

# run each one
for(i in mypdfs){
    x <- rbind(x, f_pdf_str_match(i, "black", ignore.case = TRUE))
}

# ignore NAs
x %>% filter(!is.na(page_num))

```

We will use these data sets and metadata for the next several lessons. The methods presented in today's lesson should increase efficiency and reduce busy-work.

<h2>Topic: Add Health data: variable creation and tabulation</h2>
This week's lesson will provide more background on variable creation and tabulation of variables.

## Creating value labels
"Labeled" data are important for documentation of data sets. The labels can apply to different objects, e.g., columns (as we saw in the column labels used to "decode" the data set in `AHwave1_v1.dta`, Section \@ref(tidyverse)), or to individual values of variables, e.g., the attribute `labels` of the variable `h1gi1m`:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven <- haven::read_dta("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
attributes(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi1m)$labels
```

```
##   (1) January  (2) February     (3) March     (4) April       (5) May 
##             1             2             3             4             5 
##      (6) June      (7) July    (8) August (9) September  (10) October 
##             6             7             8             9            10 
## (11) November (12) December  (96) Refused 
##            11            12            96
```

Consider the difference between different file formats. Here we will save the data set, once as a CSV file and once an RDS file:


```r
# temp dir
mytempdir <- tempdir()

write.csv(x = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
saveRDS(object = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.RDS"))
```

Then we will read them back in and investigate their structure. Here we are using a temporary folder, specified using the `tmpdir()` function. Each time an R session is started, a unique temporary folder is used. For this session the temporary dir is C:\Temp\15\RtmpSqoTtG. First, read the CSV format:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_csv <- read.csv(file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.csv"))
```

What kind of object is this?


```r
is(AHwave1_v1_haven_csv)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame" "list"       "oldClass"   "vector"
```

It is a simple data frame. What attributes does this data set have? Here we list the attributes and enumerate the first 6 elements of each attribute


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_csv %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    map(~ head(.))
```

```
## $names
## [1] "aid"     "imonth"  "iday"    "iyear"   "bio_sex" "h1gi1m" 
## 
## $class
## [1] "data.frame"
## 
## $row.names
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

There are three attributes, `names`, which are the individual column names; `class`, indicating this is a data frame, and `row.names`, in this case a serial number 1 .. n.

Do the columns have any attributes?


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_csv$h1gi1m %>% 
    attributes() 
```

```
## NULL
```

No, the columns have no attributes.

Now we will read in the RDS file:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_rds <- readRDS(file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.RDS"))
```

What kind of object is this?


```r
is(AHwave1_v1_haven_rds)
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame" "list"       "oldClass"  
## [6] "vector"
```

It is a data frame--but an example of the `tidyr` subclass `tibble`; see the [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tibble) 

What attributes does this data set have?


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_rds %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    map(~ head(.))
```

```
## $class
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
## 
## $row.names
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
## 
## $label
## [1] "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-200"
## 
## $names
## [1] "aid"     "imonth"  "iday"    "iyear"   "bio_sex" "h1gi1m"
```

The overall attributes are similar to the basic data frame, but there is an overall data set label, `National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-200` (_sic_).

We can also look at the attributes of specific columns:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven_rds$h1gi1m %>% 
    attributes()
```

```
## $label
## [1] "S1Q1 BIRTH MONTH-W1"
## 
## $format.stata
## [1] "%13.0f"
## 
## $class
## [1] "haven_labelled" "vctrs_vctr"     "double"        
## 
## $labels
##   (1) January  (2) February     (3) March     (4) April       (5) May 
##             1             2             3             4             5 
##      (6) June      (7) July    (8) August (9) September  (10) October 
##             6             7             8             9            10 
## (11) November (12) December  (96) Refused 
##            11            12            96
```

Here we see that all of the original column attributes were preserved when the data set was saved in RDS format.

__Importantly__, saving a data set in CSV format loses any built-in metadata, whereas saving in RDS format maintains the built-in metadata. For other plain text formats, metadata will not be maintained; for other formats, it is worth determining whether such metadata are maintained. If metadata are not maintained in the file structure of the data set, it will be important to maintain the metadata in an external format (e.g., text, PDF).

### Creating factor variables
Factor variables are used in R to store categorical variables. These categorical variables can be nominal, in which each value is distinct and not ordered, such as race, classified as 

* White
* Black/African American
* American Indian
* Asian/Pacific Islander
* other

Factor variables can be ordered, where there is a difference in amount or intensity, such as self-reported health status:

1. Excellent
1. Very good
1. Good
1. Fair
1. Poor

Ordinal variables may or may not have equal intervals; for example, the "distance" between excellent and good health may not represent the same "distance" as the difference between good and fair health.

Structurally, factor variables are stored as integers that can be linked to text labels. Operationally, __the use of factor variables is important in statistical modeling, so that the variables are handled correctly as being categorical__.

Factor variables are created using the `factor()` or `as_factor()` functions. Here we will convert the self-reported general health variable (`h1gh1`) to a factor. First, let's look at the variable:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1 %>% 
    attributes()
```

```
## $label
## [1] "S3Q1 GENERAL HEALTH-W1"
## 
## $format.stata
## [1] "%14.0f"
## 
## $class
## [1] "haven_labelled" "vctrs_vctr"     "double"        
## 
## $labels
##  (1) Excellent  (2) Very good       (3) Good       (4) Fair       (5) Poor 
##              1              2              3              4              5 
##    (6) Refused (8) Don't know 
##              6              8
```

This shows that there are values 1 through 6 and 8, with coding indicated in the `labels` attribute. Using `head()` also reveals the structure of the variable, including the label for the variable itself as well as the coding of the variable values:


```r
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1)
```

```
## <labelled<double>[6]>: S3Q1 GENERAL HEALTH-W1
## [1] 3 4 4 4 3 3
## 
## Labels:
##  value          label
##      1  (1) Excellent
##      2  (2) Very good
##      3       (3) Good
##      4       (4) Fair
##      5       (5) Poor
##      6    (6) Refused
##      8 (8) Don't know
```


Here we convert the variable to a factor:


```r
AHwave1_v1_haven$health <- factor(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1)
```

What is the result? We can see from the first few values; `head()` presents the values as well as the levels.


```r
# look at the first few values of the factor variable
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$health)
```

```
## [1] 3 4 4 4 3 3
## Levels: 1 2 3 4 5 6 8
```

Although the levels are in numerical order, there are no meaningful labels. We use the `labels = ` argument to assign labels to each level. Simultaneously, because the factor is ordered in the same order as the alphanumeric ordering of the attributes, we can set the ordering based on those attributes. Finally, we reverse the order of the levels so that better health has a higher position in the order.


```r
# extract the labels from the column attribute
health_levels <- AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1 %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    extract2("labels") %>% 
    names()

# create the factor variable
AHwave1_v1_haven$health <- factor(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1, 
                                  labels = health_levels, 
                                  ordered = TRUE) %>% 
    fct_relevel(rev)
```

_[Note that if the ordering is not alphanumeric, one should enter the list of values as `... labels = c("label1", "label2, ..., "labeln"), ordered = TRUE ...` to enforce correct ordering.]_

Let's compare the two variables through simple tabulation. Here is the "raw" variable:


```r
# "raw" variable
(tab_h1gh1 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
     group_by(h1gh1) %>% 
     summarise(n = n()))
```

```
## # A tibble: 7 x 2
##                h1gh1     n
##            <dbl+lbl> <int>
## 1 1 [(1) Excellent]   1847
## 2 2 [(2) Very good]   2608
## 3 3 [(3) Good]        1605
## 4 4 [(4) Fair]         408
## 5 5 [(5) Poor]          28
## 6 6 [(6) Refused]        3
## 7 8 [(8) Don't know]     5
```

The "raw" variable shows that it is a labeled, double precision variable (`<dbl+lbl>`). 

Now the factor variable:


```r
# factor variable
(tab_health <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
     group_by(health) %>% 
     summarise(n = n()))
```

```
## # A tibble: 7 x 2
##   health             n
##   <ord>          <int>
## 1 (8) Don't know     5
## 2 (6) Refused        3
## 3 (5) Poor          28
## 4 (4) Fair         408
## 5 (3) Good        1605
## 6 (2) Very good   2608
## 7 (1) Excellent   1847
```

The counts are the same, but for the factor variable, the `<ord>` additionally indicates the ordering of health levels. Note that the order is different because `(1) Excellent` should have the highest numerical value.

Bar plots also show the difference between the raw and factor variables. Here is a bar plot from the raw variable. 


```r
ggplot(data = tab_h1gh1, aes(x = h1gh1, y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    coord_flip()
```

<img src="07-week07_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" />

Because the numerical values have no special meaning, the bar plot uses its default method of displaying the axes. Here is the bar plot created with the factor variable, which shows informative labels at the correct position on the axes.


```r
ggplot(data = tab_health, mapping = aes(x = health, y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    coord_flip()
```

<img src="07-week07_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" />

One of the potential down sides to using factor variables is that using the text values requires additional code. For example, to select (`filter()`) a subset of records, there are two methods. The first method uses the label. In this case because the factor is ordered, it is possible to use an ordinal comparison.



```r
# filter for Excellent or Very good
y <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter (health <= "(2) Very good")

# tabulate
table(y$health)
```

```
## 
## (8) Don't know    (6) Refused       (5) Poor       (4) Fair       (3) Good 
##              5              3             28            408           1605 
##  (2) Very good  (1) Excellent 
##           2608              0
```

The other method is to use `as_numeric()` to specify the underlying numerical values. In this case, because the value of 2 indicated `Very good`, we can filter for `health %>% as.numeric() <= 2`.  


```r
x <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(health %>% as.numeric() <= 2)
```

Using unordered factor variables shows that more coding is involved in specifying values in `filter()` statements. For example, let's create a factor variable for the interviewer's observed single race variable:


```r
# number of labels
nlabs <- length(unique(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9))
# get the values, "as.numeric()"
obsrace_values <- AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9 %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    extract2("labels") %>% 
    as.numeric()

# get the labels, names()
obsrace_labels <- AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9 %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    extract2("labels") %>% 
    names() 

# create the factor
AHwave1_v1_haven$obsrace <- factor(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9, 
                                   levels = obsrace_values, 
                                   labels = obsrace_labels)
```

Suppose we wanted to make a subset of only White and Black records, there are a few syntax methods:

Here, each value is explicitly named, using the `|` "or" operator 


```r
dat_wb1 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(obsrace == "(1) White" |
           obsrace == "(2) Black/African American")

table(dat_wb1$obsrace)
```

```
## 
##                           (1) White          (2) Black/African American 
##                                4291                                1601 
## (3) American Indian/Native American          (4) Asian/Pacific Islander 
##                                   0                                   0 
##                           (5) Other                         (6) Refused 
##                                   0                                   0 
##                      (8) Don't know                  (9) Not applicable 
##                                   0                                   0
```

A different approach uses `str_detect()` with a regular expression to match any values of `obsrace` that contain the strings `white` or `black` in any upper/lower case combination.


```r
dat_wb2 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(str_detect(obsrace, regex("white|black", ignore_case = TRUE)))

table(dat_wb2$obsrace)
```

```
## 
##                           (1) White          (2) Black/African American 
##                                4291                                1601 
## (3) American Indian/Native American          (4) Asian/Pacific Islander 
##                                   0                                   0 
##                           (5) Other                         (6) Refused 
##                                   0                                   0 
##                      (8) Don't know                  (9) Not applicable 
##                                   0                                   0
```

Finally, if we know the numeric values representing the factors, we can use those directly:


```r
dat_wb3 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(obsrace %>% as.numeric() %in% c(1, 2))

table(dat_wb3$obsrace)
```

```
## 
##                           (1) White          (2) Black/African American 
##                                4291                                1601 
## (3) American Indian/Native American          (4) Asian/Pacific Islander 
##                                   0                                   0 
##                           (5) Other                         (6) Refused 
##                                   0                                   0 
##                      (8) Don't know                  (9) Not applicable 
##                                   0                                   0
```

The first method is the most verbose, requires the most code, and is probably the easiest to read. The other two methods may be easier to code (i.e., fewer keystrokes), but seem to be more difficult to interpret.

As above, care needs to be taken in saving the data set to a file. If the factor has text labels, those will be written to an output CSV file. When they are read back in, they will be treated as character values rather than factors. For example, the `health` variable we created is an ordered factor:


```r
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$health)
```

```
## [1] (3) Good (4) Fair (4) Fair (4) Fair (3) Good (3) Good
## 7 Levels: (8) Don't know < (6) Refused < (5) Poor < (4) Fair < ... < (1) Excellent
```

But when cycled through a write/read CSV cycle, the variable is not maintained as a factor.


```r
write.csv(x = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "foo.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

y <- read.csv(file.path(mytempdir, "foo.csv"))

head(y$health)
```

```
## [1] "(3) Good" "(4) Fair" "(4) Fair" "(4) Fair" "(3) Good" "(3) Good"
```

Additional work would be needed to re-establish it as a factor. Fortunately, the alphanumeric sorting order of the character strings is the logical order; without the numeric values, the ordering would need to be explicitly set. For example, the vector in desired sorting order `"Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor", "Refused", "Don't know"` sorts as `Don't know, Excellent, Fair, Good, Poor, Refused, Very good`), which is not the proper sorting order.


```r
y$health <- factor(y$health,
                   labels = y$health %>% unique() %>% sort(),
                   ordered = TRUE)
head(y$health)
```

```
## [1] (3) Good (4) Fair (4) Fair (4) Fair (3) Good (3) Good
## 7 Levels: (1) Excellent < (2) Very good < (3) Good < (4) Fair < ... < (8) Don't know
```

If you save the data set as RDS, the factor and other structures are maintained.


```r
write_rds(x = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "foo.Rds"))

z <- readRDS(file = file.path(mytempdir, "foo.Rds"))

head(z$health)
```

```
## [1] (3) Good (4) Fair (4) Fair (4) Fair (3) Good (3) Good
## 7 Levels: (8) Don't know < (6) Refused < (5) Poor < (4) Fair < ... < (1) Excellent
```

### Creating attributes
In addition to creating factors, which can serve in some capacity as self-documenting (i.e., the value labels should be at least somewhat self-explanatory), we can create attributes as we have seen with the Stata `.dta` files.

Let's start with the CSV file, which we know was stripped of its descriptive attributes:


```r
y <- read.csv(file.path(mytempdir, "foo.csv"))

y %>% attributes() %>% map(~ head(.))
```

```
## $names
## [1] "aid"     "imonth"  "iday"    "iyear"   "bio_sex" "h1gi1m" 
## 
## $class
## [1] "data.frame"
## 
## $row.names
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

First, an attribute of the data frame itself:


```r
attributes(y)$label <- "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-2000 with some variable additions"
```

... which we can verify:


```r
y %>% attributes() %>% extract("label")
```

```
## $label
## [1] "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-2000 with some variable additions"
```

Next, attributes for the `health` and `obsrace` variables, documenting the variables and values:


```r
# label for health
attributes(y$health)$label <- "General health from public Add Health Wave 1 Section 3 question 1"
# values for health
attributes(y$health)$levels <- c("(1) Excellent", "(2) Very good", "(3) Good", "(4) Fair", "(5) Poor", "(6) Refused", "(8) Don't know")

# label for obsrace
attributes(y$obsrace)$label <- "Interviewer observation of race from public Add Health Wave 1 Section 1 question 9"
# values  for obsrace
attributes(y$obsrace)$levels <- c("(1) White", "(2) Black/African American", "(3) American Indian/Native American", "(4) Asian/Pacific Islander", "(5) Other", "(6) Refused", "(8) Don't know", "(9) Not applicable")
```

Verify these were created:


```r
y$health %>% attributes()
```

```
## $label
## [1] "General health from public Add Health Wave 1 Section 3 question 1"
## 
## $levels
## [1] "(1) Excellent"  "(2) Very good"  "(3) Good"       "(4) Fair"      
## [5] "(5) Poor"       "(6) Refused"    "(8) Don't know"
```

```r
y$obsrace %>% attributes()
```

```
## $label
## [1] "Interviewer observation of race from public Add Health Wave 1 Section 1 question 9"
## 
## $levels
## [1] "(1) White"                           "(2) Black/African American"         
## [3] "(3) American Indian/Native American" "(4) Asian/Pacific Islander"         
## [5] "(5) Other"                           "(6) Refused"                        
## [7] "(8) Don't know"                      "(9) Not applicable"
```

The same caveats apply to saving the data frame to files.

## Tabulation
We have seen a few examples of tabulation in previous exercises (Sections \@ref(summarizingaggregating-data), \@ref(tables-in-r-markdown), \@ref(default-values-for-arguments)). This section will give a more complete treatment using the Add Health data as an example.

### Raw counts
The most basic tabulations simply give the count of observations in different strata. Those strata can be based on numeric ratio or interval data, using functions such as `cut()` or `BAMMtools::getJenksBreaks()`, nominal data (such as the Add Health interviewer's observation of respondents' single race), or ordinal data (such as the self-reported health status). We will use examples of each type of data.

First, this code will load the full Add Health data set, which includes additional variables not present in the data set we have used previously.


```r
# download and unzip the larger data set
myUrl <- "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip"
# zip file in $temp
zipfile <- file.path(mytempdir, basename(myUrl))
# dta file in $temp
dtafile <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(zipfile)
# check if the dta file exists
if(!file.exists(dtafile)){
    # if the dta file doesn't exist, check for the zip file
    # check if the zip file exists, download if necessary
    if(!file.exists(zipfile)){
        curl::curl_download(url = myUrl, destfile = zipfile)
    }
    # unzip the downloaded zip file
    unzip(zipfile = zipfile, exdir = mytempdir)
}

# if the data set has not been read, read it in 
if(!exists("ahcomplete")){
    ahcomplete <- haven::read_dta(dtafile)
}
# lowercase column names
colnames(ahcomplete) %<>% str_to_lower()
```

Present the metadata (variable names and labels):


```r
ahcomplete_metadata <- bind_cols(
    varname = colnames(ahcomplete),
    varlabel = ahcomplete %>% map(~ attributes(.)$label) %>% unlist()
)

DT::datatable(ahcomplete_metadata)
```

Let's look at body mass index (BMI) data, which uses weight and height values. We find the variables representing weight and height from the metadata above. We need to determine if there are any invalid values:


```r
attributes(ahcomplete$h1gh59a)$labels
```

```
##      (4) 4 feet      (5) 5 feet      (6) 6 feet    (96) Refused (98) Don't know 
##               4               5               6              96              98
```

```r
attributes(ahcomplete$h1gh59b)$labels
```

```
##        (0) 0 inches          (1) 1 inch        (2) 2 inches        (3) 3 inches 
##                   0                   1                   2                   3 
##        (4) 4 inches        (5) 5 inches        (6) 6 inches        (7) 7 inches 
##                   4                   5                   6                   7 
##        (8) 8 inches        (9) 9 inches      (10) 10 inches      (11) 11 inches 
##                   8                   9                  10                  11 
##        (96) Refused     (98) Don't know (99) Not applicable 
##                  96                  98                  99
```

```r
attributes(ahcomplete$h1gh60)$labels
```

```
##        (996) Refused     (998) Don't know (999) Not applicable 
##                  996                  998                  999
```

First, we need to select the variables representing feet and inches, then filter out invalid heights (> 90) and weights (> 900) identified above, and finally calculate height in m, weight in kg, and BMI ($\frac{weight\_{kg}}{{height\_m}^2}$). For future use we will also select self-reported health and interviewer observed race as factors.


```r
# make the data frame
htwt <- ahcomplete %>% 
    # select columns
    select(feet = h1gh59a,
           inches = h1gh59b,
           weight_lb = h1gh60,
           health = h1gh1,
           obsrace = h1gi9) %>% 
    # filter for valid values
    filter(feet < 90 & inches < 90 & weight_lb < 900) %>% 
    # calculate 
    mutate(height_m = (feet * 12 + inches) / 39.37008,
           weight_kg = weight_lb / 2.205,
           BMI = weight_kg / height_m^2)

# factor: get values and labels
healthvals <- htwt$health %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% as.numeric()
healthlabs <- htwt$health %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% names()

racevals <- htwt$obsrace %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% as.numeric()
racelabs <- htwt$obsrace %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% names()

htwt %<>% 
    mutate(health = factor(health,
                           levels = healthvals,
                           labels = healthlabs),
           obsrace = factor(obsrace,
                           levels = racevals,
                           labels = racelabs))
```

A histogram shows the distribution of BMI for the respondents with vertical lines at the 5th and 85th percentile. This range is generally considered "normal" or "healthy" according to the CDC, although for a sample with varying age, sex, height, and weight ranges, it is difficult to interpret. Nevertheless the cut points can serve the purpose of demonstration.


```r
# get the 5th & 85th percentile
bmibreaks <- quantile(x = htwt$BMI, probs = c(0.05, 0.85))
ggplot(htwt, aes(x = BMI)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = bmibreaks)
```

<img src="07-week07_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="672" />

We assign the BMI class using these cut points, with `cut()` breaks at the minimum, 5%, 85%, and maximum BMI, and also assign labels and set ordering:


```r
htwt %<>% 
    mutate(bmiclass = cut(x = BMI, 
                          breaks = c(min(BMI), bmibreaks, max(BMI)), 
                          labels = c("underweight", "normal", "overweight"),
                          include.lowest = TRUE) %>% 
               factor(ordered = TRUE))
```

The tabulation of count of respondents by weight class can be generated with the base R function `table()` or `dplyr` functions `group_by()` and `summarise()`.


```r
# base R
table(htwt$bmiclass, useNA = "ifany")
```

```
## 
## underweight      normal  overweight 
##         324        5023         944
```


```r
# tidyR
htwt %>% 
    group_by(bmiclass) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> bmiclass </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> n </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> underweight </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 324 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> normal </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 5023 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> overweight </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 944 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For variables that are already nominal or ordinal factors, tabulations can be made directly. Because these were converted to factors, the correct labels will show, rather than simple numeric values.


```r
htwt %>% 
    group_by(health) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> health </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> n </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (1) Excellent </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1803 </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1 </td>

```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">

### Proportions/percentages
Proportions and percentages can be added to tabulations for greater interpretability. Using base R, the `prop_table()` function can be used as a wrapper around `table()` to generate proportions, optionally multiplying by 100 to generate a percentage. Remember to round as needed. For example:


```r
round(prop.table(table(htwt$bmiclass)), 2)
```

```
## 
## underweight      normal  overweight 
##        0.05        0.80        0.15
```

```r
round(prop.table(table(htwt$bmiclass)) * 100, 0)
```

```
## 
## underweight      normal  overweight 
##           5          80          15
```

Not surprisingly, the BMI classes show 5% underweight and 15% overweight, because that is how the stratification was defined.

The `tidyR` version requires a bit more coding but provides a more readable output. Because the percent sign is a special character, we enclose it in back ticks, ``%``. Here we generate a tabulation of observed race.


```r
htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = `%` %>% round(1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> obsrace </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> n </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> % </th>

  <tr>

  <tr>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1525 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 24.2 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (3) American Indian/Native American </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 68 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1.1 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (4) Asian/Pacific Islander </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 230 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 3.7 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (5) Other </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 280 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 4.5 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (6) Refused </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.0 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (8) Don't know </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 3 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.0 </td>
  </tr>

### Stratified tabulation
Tabulations can be generated using multiple variables. Here we will examine BMI and race as well as BMI and health. The percentages sum to 100 based on the order of the grouping.

Here, we see the relative percent of underweight, normal, and overweight within each race class:


```r
htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace,
             bmiclass) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = `%` %>% round(1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">

Even though the `n` values are the same in the two tables (e.g., underweight White n = 234), the percentages are different due to grouping. That is, the percent of underweight persons among the White race stratum is different from the percent of White persons within the underweight stratum. Proper grouping is critical to answer specific questions about the data.

Another way to understand the data, preferred by some, would be to make a graph. For example, BMI by race:


```r
bmi_race <- htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace,
             bmiclass) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    filter(!str_detect(obsrace, regex("refused|know", ignore_case = TRUE)))

ggplot(data = bmi_race, mapping = aes(x = bmiclass, y = `%`)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
    facet_grid(~obsrace)
```

    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

<h2>Topic: Add Health data: variable creation and tabulation</h2>
This week's lesson will provide more background on variable creation and tabulation of variables.

## Creating value labels
"Labeled" data are important for documentation of data sets. The labels can apply to different objects, e.g., columns (as we saw in the column labels used to "decode" the data set in `AHwave1_v1.dta`, Section \@ref(tidyverse)), or to individual values of variables, e.g., the attribute `labels` of the variable `h1gi1m`:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven <- haven::read_dta("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
attributes(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi1m)$labels
```

Consider the difference between different file formats. Here we will save the data set, once as a CSV file and once an RDS file:

```{r}
# temp dir
mytempdir <- tempdir()

write.csv(x = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.csv"), row.names = FALSE)
saveRDS(object = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.RDS"))
```

Then we will read them back in and investigate their structure. Here we are using a temporary folder, specified using the `tmpdir()` function. Each time an R session is started, a unique temporary folder is used. For this session the temporary dir is `r mytempdir`. First, read the CSV format:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_csv <- read.csv(file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.csv"))
```

What kind of object is this?

```{r}
is(AHwave1_v1_haven_csv)
```

It is a simple data frame. What attributes does this data set have? Here we list the attributes and enumerate the first 6 elements of each attribute

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_csv %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    map(~ head(.))
```

There are three attributes, `names`, which are the individual column names; `class`, indicating this is a data frame, and `row.names`, in this case a serial number 1 .. n.

Do the columns have any attributes?

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_csv$h1gi1m %>% 
    attributes() 
```

No, the columns have no attributes.

Now we will read in the RDS file:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_rds <- readRDS(file = file.path(mytempdir, "AHwave1_v1_haven.RDS"))
```

What kind of object is this?

```{r}
is(AHwave1_v1_haven_rds)
```

It is a data frame--but an example of the `tidyr` subclass `tibble`; see the [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tibble) 

What attributes does this data set have?

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_rds %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    map(~ head(.))
```

The overall attributes are similar to the basic data frame, but there is an overall data set label, ``r AHwave1_v1_haven_rds %>% attributes() %>% extract("label")`` (_sic_).

We can also look at the attributes of specific columns:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven_rds$h1gi1m %>% 
    attributes()
```

Here we see that all of the original column attributes were preserved when the data set was saved in RDS format.

__Importantly__, saving a data set in CSV format loses any built-in metadata, whereas saving in RDS format maintains the built-in metadata. For other plain text formats, metadata will not be maintained; for other formats, it is worth determining whether such metadata are maintained. If metadata are not maintained in the file structure of the data set, it will be important to maintain the metadata in an external format (e.g., text, PDF).

### Creating factor variables
Factor variables are used in R to store categorical variables. These categorical variables can be nominal, in which each value is distinct and not ordered, such as race, classified as 

* White
* Black/African American
* American Indian
* Asian/Pacific Islander
* other

Factor variables can be ordered, where there is a difference in amount or intensity, such as self-reported health status:

1. Excellent
1. Very good
1. Good
1. Fair
1. Poor

Ordinal variables may or may not have equal intervals; for example, the "distance" between excellent and good health may not represent the same "distance" as the difference between good and fair health.

Structurally, factor variables are stored as integers that can be linked to text labels. Operationally, __the use of factor variables is important in statistical modeling, so that the variables are handled correctly as being categorical__.

Factor variables are created using the `factor()` or `as_factor()` functions. Here we will convert the self-reported general health variable (`h1gh1`) to a factor. First, let's look at the variable:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1 %>% 
    attributes()
```

This shows that there are values 1 through 6 and 8, with coding indicated in the `labels` attribute. Using `head()` also reveals the structure of the variable, including the label for the variable itself as well as the coding of the variable values:

```{r}
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1)
```


Here we convert the variable to a factor:

```{r}
AHwave1_v1_haven$health <- factor(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1)
```

What is the result? We can see from the first few values; `head()` presents the values as well as the levels.

```{r}
# look at the first few values of the factor variable
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$health)
```

Although the levels are in numerical order, there are no meaningful labels. We use the `labels = ` argument to assign labels to each level. Simultaneously, because the factor is ordered in the same order as the alphanumeric ordering of the attributes, we can set the ordering based on those attributes. Finally, we reverse the order of the levels so that better health has a higher position in the order.

```{r}
# extract the labels from the column attribute
health_levels <- AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1 %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    extract2("labels") %>% 
    names()

# create the factor variable
AHwave1_v1_haven$health <- factor(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gh1, 
                                  labels = health_levels, 
                                  ordered = TRUE) %>% 
    fct_relevel(rev)
```

_[Note that if the ordering is not alphanumeric, one should enter the list of values as `... labels = c("label1", "label2, ..., "labeln"), ordered = TRUE ...` to enforce correct ordering.]_

Let's compare the two variables through simple tabulation. Here is the "raw" variable:

```{r}
# "raw" variable
(tab_h1gh1 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
     group_by(h1gh1) %>% 
     summarise(n = n()))
```

The "raw" variable shows that it is a labeled, double precision variable (`<dbl+lbl>`). 

Now the factor variable:

```{r}
# factor variable
(tab_health <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
     group_by(health) %>% 
     summarise(n = n()))
```

The counts are the same, but for the factor variable, the `<ord>` additionally indicates the ordering of health levels. Note that the order is different because `(1) Excellent` should have the highest numerical value.

Bar plots also show the difference between the raw and factor variables. Here is a bar plot from the raw variable. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = tab_h1gh1, aes(x = h1gh1, y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    coord_flip()
```

Because the numerical values have no special meaning, the bar plot uses its default method of displaying the axes. Here is the bar plot created with the factor variable, which shows informative labels at the correct position on the axes.

```{r}
ggplot(data = tab_health, mapping = aes(x = health, y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    coord_flip()
```

One of the potential down sides to using factor variables is that using the text values requires additional code. For example, to select (`filter()`) a subset of records, there are two methods. The first method uses the label. In this case because the factor is ordered, it is possible to use an ordinal comparison.

```{r}
# filter for Excellent or Very good
y <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter (health <= "(2) Very good")

# tabulate
table(y$health)
```

The other method is to use `as_numeric()` to specify the underlying numerical values. In this case, because the value of 2 indicated `Very good`, we can filter for `health %>% as.numeric() <= 2`.  

```{r}
x <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(health %>% as.numeric() <= 2)
```

Using unordered factor variables shows that more coding is involved in specifying values in `filter()` statements. For example, let's create a factor variable for the interviewer's observed single race variable:

```{r}
# number of labels
nlabs <- length(unique(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9))
# get the values, "as.numeric()"
obsrace_values <- AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9 %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    extract2("labels") %>% 
    as.numeric()

# get the labels, names()
obsrace_labels <- AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9 %>% 
    attributes() %>% 
    extract2("labels") %>% 
    names() 

# create the factor
AHwave1_v1_haven$obsrace <- factor(AHwave1_v1_haven$h1gi9, 
                                   levels = obsrace_values, 
                                   labels = obsrace_labels)
```

Suppose we wanted to make a subset of only White and Black records, there are a few syntax methods:

Here, each value is explicitly named, using the `|` "or" operator 

```{r}
dat_wb1 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(obsrace == "(1) White" |
           obsrace == "(2) Black/African American")

table(dat_wb1$obsrace)
```

A different approach uses `str_detect()` with a regular expression to match any values of `obsrace` that contain the strings `white` or `black` in any upper/lower case combination.

```{r}
dat_wb2 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(str_detect(obsrace, regex("white|black", ignore_case = TRUE)))

table(dat_wb2$obsrace)
```

Finally, if we know the numeric values representing the factors, we can use those directly:

```{r}
dat_wb3 <- AHwave1_v1_haven %>% 
    filter(obsrace %>% as.numeric() %in% c(1, 2))

table(dat_wb3$obsrace)
```

The first method is the most verbose, requires the most code, and is probably the easiest to read. The other two methods may be easier to code (i.e., fewer keystrokes), but seem to be more difficult to interpret.

As above, care needs to be taken in saving the data set to a file. If the factor has text labels, those will be written to an output CSV file. When they are read back in, they will be treated as character values rather than factors. For example, the `health` variable we created is an ordered factor:

```{r}
head(AHwave1_v1_haven$health)
```

But when cycled through a write/read CSV cycle, the variable is not maintained as a factor.

```{r}
write.csv(x = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "foo.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

y <- read.csv(file.path(mytempdir, "foo.csv"))

head(y$health)
```

Additional work would be needed to re-establish it as a factor. Fortunately, the alphanumeric sorting order of the character strings is the logical order; without the numeric values, the ordering would need to be explicitly set. For example, the vector in desired sorting order `"Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor", "Refused", "Don't know"` sorts as ``r c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor", "Refused", "Don't know") %>% sort()``), which is not the proper sorting order.

```{r}
y$health <- factor(y$health,
                   labels = y$health %>% unique() %>% sort(),
                   ordered = TRUE)
head(y$health)
```

If you save the data set as RDS, the factor and other structures are maintained.

```{r}
write_rds(x = AHwave1_v1_haven, file = file.path(mytempdir, "foo.Rds"))

z <- readRDS(file = file.path(mytempdir, "foo.Rds"))

head(z$health)
```

### Creating attributes
In addition to creating factors, which can serve in some capacity as self-documenting (i.e., the value labels should be at least somewhat self-explanatory), we can create attributes as we have seen with the Stata `.dta` files.

Let's start with the CSV file, which we know was stripped of its descriptive attributes:

```{r}
y <- read.csv(file.path(mytempdir, "foo.csv"))

y %>% attributes() %>% map(~ head(.))
```

First, an attribute of the data frame itself:

```{r}
attributes(y)$label <- "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-2000 with some variable additions"
```

... which we can verify:

```{r}
y %>% attributes() %>% extract("label")
```

Next, attributes for the `health` and `obsrace` variables, documenting the variables and values:

```{r}
# label for health
attributes(y$health)$label <- "General health from public Add Health Wave 1 Section 3 question 1"
# values for health
attributes(y$health)$levels <- c("(1) Excellent", "(2) Very good", "(3) Good", "(4) Fair", "(5) Poor", "(6) Refused", "(8) Don't know")

# label for obsrace
attributes(y$obsrace)$label <- "Interviewer observation of race from public Add Health Wave 1 Section 1 question 9"
# values  for obsrace
attributes(y$obsrace)$levels <- c("(1) White", "(2) Black/African American", "(3) American Indian/Native American", "(4) Asian/Pacific Islander", "(5) Other", "(6) Refused", "(8) Don't know", "(9) Not applicable")
```

Verify these were created:

```{r}
y$health %>% attributes()
y$obsrace %>% attributes()
```

The same caveats apply to saving the data frame to files.

## Tabulation
We have seen a few examples of tabulation in previous exercises (Sections \@ref(summarizingaggregating-data), \@ref(tables-in-r-markdown), \@ref(default-values-for-arguments)). This section will give a more complete treatment using the Add Health data as an example.

### Raw counts
The most basic tabulations simply give the count of observations in different strata. Those strata can be based on numeric ratio or interval data, using functions such as `cut()` or `BAMMtools::getJenksBreaks()`, nominal data (such as the Add Health interviewer's observation of respondents' single race), or ordinal data (such as the self-reported health status). We will use examples of each type of data.

First, this code will load the full Add Health data set, which includes additional variables not present in the data set we have used previously.

```{r}
# download and unzip the larger data set
myUrl <- "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip"
# zip file in $temp
zipfile <- file.path(mytempdir, basename(myUrl))
# dta file in $temp
dtafile <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(zipfile)
# check if the dta file exists
if(!file.exists(dtafile)){
    # if the dta file doesn't exist, check for the zip file
    # check if the zip file exists, download if necessary
    if(!file.exists(zipfile)){
        curl::curl_download(url = myUrl, destfile = zipfile)
    }
    # unzip the downloaded zip file
    unzip(zipfile = zipfile, exdir = mytempdir)
}

# if the data set has not been read, read it in 
if(!exists("ahcomplete")){
    ahcomplete <- haven::read_dta(dtafile)
}
# lowercase column names
colnames(ahcomplete) %<>% str_to_lower()
```

Present the metadata (variable names and labels):

```{r}
ahcomplete_metadata <- bind_cols(
    varname = colnames(ahcomplete),
    varlabel = ahcomplete %>% map(~ attributes(.)$label) %>% unlist()
)

DT::datatable(ahcomplete_metadata)
```

\  
Let's look at body mass index (BMI) data, which uses weight and height values. We find the variables representing weight and height from the metadata above. We need to determine if there are any invalid values:

```{r}
attributes(ahcomplete$h1gh59a)$labels
attributes(ahcomplete$h1gh59b)$labels
attributes(ahcomplete$h1gh60)$labels
```

First, we need to select the variables representing feet and inches, then filter out invalid heights (> 90) and weights (> 900) identified above, and finally calculate height in m, weight in kg, and BMI ($\frac{weight\_{kg}}{{height\_m}^2}$). For future use we will also select self-reported health and interviewer observed race as factors.

```{r}
# make the data frame
htwt <- ahcomplete %>% 
    # select columns
    select(feet = h1gh59a,
           inches = h1gh59b,
           weight_lb = h1gh60,
           health = h1gh1,
           obsrace = h1gi9) %>% 
    # filter for valid values
    filter(feet < 90 & inches < 90 & weight_lb < 900) %>% 
    # calculate 
    mutate(height_m = (feet * 12 + inches) / 39.37008,
           weight_kg = weight_lb / 2.205,
           BMI = weight_kg / height_m^2)

# factor: get values and labels
healthvals <- htwt$health %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% as.numeric()
healthlabs <- htwt$health %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% names()

racevals <- htwt$obsrace %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% as.numeric()
racelabs <- htwt$obsrace %>% attributes() %>% extract2("labels") %>% names()

htwt %<>% 
    mutate(health = factor(health,
                           levels = healthvals,
                           labels = healthlabs),
           obsrace = factor(obsrace,
                           levels = racevals,
                           labels = racelabs))
```

A histogram shows the distribution of BMI for the respondents with vertical lines at the 5th and 85th percentile. This range is generally considered "normal" or "healthy" according to the CDC, although for a sample with varying age, sex, height, and weight ranges, it is difficult to interpret. Nevertheless the cut points can serve the purpose of demonstration.

```{r}
# get the 5th & 85th percentile
bmibreaks <- quantile(x = htwt$BMI, probs = c(0.05, 0.85))
ggplot(htwt, aes(x = BMI)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = bmibreaks)
```

We assign the BMI class using these cut points, with `cut()` breaks at the minimum, 5%, 85%, and maximum BMI, and also assign labels and set ordering:

```{r}
htwt %<>% 
    mutate(bmiclass = cut(x = BMI, 
                          breaks = c(min(BMI), bmibreaks, max(BMI)), 
                          labels = c("underweight", "normal", "overweight"),
                          include.lowest = TRUE) %>% 
               factor(ordered = TRUE))
```

The tabulation of count of respondents by weight class can be generated with the base R function `table()` or `dplyr` functions `group_by()` and `summarise()`.

```{r}
# base R
table(htwt$bmiclass, useNA = "ifany")
```

```{r}
# tidyR
htwt %>% 
    group_by(bmiclass) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

For variables that are already nominal or ordinal factors, tabulations can be made directly. Because these were converted to factors, the correct labels will show, rather than simple numeric values.

```{r}
htwt %>% 
    group_by(health) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

```{r}
htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

### Proportions/percentages
Proportions and percentages can be added to tabulations for greater interpretability. Using base R, the `prop_table()` function can be used as a wrapper around `table()` to generate proportions, optionally multiplying by 100 to generate a percentage. Remember to round as needed. For example:

```{r}
round(prop.table(table(htwt$bmiclass)), 2)

round(prop.table(table(htwt$bmiclass)) * 100, 0)
```

Not surprisingly, the BMI classes show 5% underweight and 15% overweight, because that is how the stratification was defined.

The `tidyR` version requires a bit more coding but provides a more readable output. Because the percent sign is a special character, we enclose it in back ticks, ``%``. Here we generate a tabulation of observed race.

```{r}
htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = `%` %>% round(1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

### Stratified tabulation
Tabulations can be generated using multiple variables. Here we will examine BMI and race as well as BMI and health. The percentages sum to 100 based on the order of the grouping.

Here, we see the relative percent of underweight, normal, and overweight within each race class:

```{r}
htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace,
             bmiclass) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = `%` %>% round(1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

And here we see the relative percent of different race groups within each BMI class. 

```{r}
htwt %>% 
    group_by(bmiclass,
             obsrace) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    mutate(`%` = `%` %>% round(1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

Even though the `n` values are the same in the two tables (e.g., underweight White n = `r htwt %>% filter(str_detect(obsrace, "White") & str_detect(bmiclass, "under")) %>% nrow()`), the percentages are different due to grouping. That is, the percent of underweight persons among the White race stratum is different from the percent of White persons within the underweight stratum. Proper grouping is critical to answer specific questions about the data.

Another way to understand the data, preferred by some, would be to make a graph. For example, BMI by race:

```{r}
bmi_race <- htwt %>% 
    group_by(obsrace,
             bmiclass) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate(`%` = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
    filter(!str_detect(obsrace, regex("refused|know", ignore_case = TRUE)))

ggplot(data = bmi_race, mapping = aes(x = bmiclass, y = `%`)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
    facet_grid(~obsrace)

ggplot(data = bmi_race, mapping = aes(x = obsrace, y = `%`, fill = bmiclass)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

# Week 8 {#week8}



<h2>Topic: Add Health data: variable creation and scale scoring</h2>
This week's lesson will provide more background on variable creation and scale scoring. The scale scoring exercise will be used to create a single variable that represents how well respondents did overall on a subset of questions.

## Scale scoring
We will be using data from the Knowledge Quiz. Download or open [21600-0001-Codebook_Questionnaire.pdf](http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/metadata/Wave1_Comprehensive_Codebook/21600-0001-Codebook_Questionnaire.pdf) in a new window or tab and go to page 203, or search for the string `H1KQ1A`.

We will be using the file `AHwave1_v1.dta`, which is downloaded and read in the following code chunk, along with presentation of the column names, labels, and values.


```r
dat <- haven::read_dta("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/AHwave1_v1.dta")

metadata <- bind_cols(
    # variable name
    varname = colnames(dat),
    # label
    varlabel = lapply(dat, function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist(),
    # values
    varvalues = lapply(dat, function(x) attributes(x)$labels) %>% 
        # names the variable label vector
        lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
        # as character
        as.character() %>% 
        # remove the c() construction
        str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$")
)

DT::datatable(metadata)
```

Questions `H1KQ1A`, `H1KQ2A`, ..., `H1KQ10A` are factual questions about contraception that are administered to participants $\ge$ age 15. We will be creating a single score that sums up all the correct answers across these questions for each participant $\ge$ age 15. Because the set of questions is paired, with question "a" being the factual portion and "b" being the level of confidence, we want only those questions with column names ending with "a".

### Selecting specific columns
There are several ways of selecting the desired columns into a new data frame. Here is brute force approach:


```r
# create a data frame of some columns and age >= 15
mydat_bruteforce <- dat %>% 
    # drop those under 15 y
    filter(h1kq1a != 7) %>% 
    # get answers
    select(
        aid, # subject ID
        h1kq1a,
        h1kq2a,
        h1kq3a,
        h1kq4a,
        h1kq5a,
        h1kq6a,
        h1kq7a,
        h1kq8a,
        h1kq9a,
        h1kq10a
    )
```

Although there were only 10 columns with this name pattern, what if there had been 30 or 50? You would not want to have to enter each column name separately. Not only would this be tedious, there would always be the possibility of making a keyboarding mistake.

Instead of the brute force approach, we can use the `matches()` function with a regular expression. The regular expression here is `^h1kq.*a$`, which translates to "at the start of the string, match `h1kq`, then any number of any characters, then `a` followed by the end of the string".


```r
mydat <- dat %>% 
    filter(h1kq1a != 7) %>% 
    select(
        aid,
        matches("h1kq.*a")
    )
```

We check that both processes yielded the same result:


```r
identical(mydat_bruteforce, mydat)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

### Comparing participant answers to correct answers

Now that we have a data frame limited to the participants in the correct age range and only the questions we want, we need to set up tests for whether the questions were answered correctly or not. From the metadata we can see that for some questions, the correct answer was `(1) true` and for some, the correct answer was `(2) false`.

We can scan through the questions in the metadata to create a vector of correct answers:


```r
# the correct answers
correct <- c(2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2) 
# make a named vector of the answers using the selected column names
names(correct) <- str_subset(string = names(mydat),
                             pattern = "h1kq.*a")
```

What we now need to do is compare this vector to a vector constructed of the answers in `mydat`. There are a few approaches that could be taken. A brute force approach could use a loop to iterate over each record in the answers, and for each record to iterate over each answer:


```r
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()

# make an output
ans_loop <- NULL

# iterate over rows
#testing:
#for(i in 1:3){ 
for(i in 1:nrow(mydat)){
    # init a vector
    Q <- NULL
    # iterate over columns, ignoring the first "aid" column
    for(j in 2:ncol(mydat)){
        # get the value of the answer
        ans_subj <- mydat[i, j]
        # get the correct answer
        ans_actual <- correct[j - 1]
        # compare
        cmp <- ans_actual == ans_subj
        # append
        Q <- c(Q, cmp)
    }
    # append
    ans_loop <- rbind(ans_loop, Q)
}

# package it up nicely
ans_loop %<>% data.frame()
colnames(ans_loop) <- names(correct)
row.names(ans_loop) <- NULL

# timing
t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_loop <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(1)
```

It took 20.3 s to run. This low performance is because the algorithm is visiting every cell and comparing one-by-on with a rotating value for the correct answer from the vector of correct answers. Each object is required to be handled separately in RAM as the process continues.

Another approach uses `plyr::adply()`, which runs a function over a set of rows. The [`plyr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plyr/) package contains a set of tools for splitting data, applying functions, and recombining.


```r
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()

ans_adply <- mydat %>% 
    select(-1) %>% 
    plyr::adply(.margins = 1, 
                function(x) x == correct)

t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_adply <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(1)
```

The `adply()` version takes far less coding, but still took 20.5 s to run.

Yet another different approach compares the data frame of participant answers to the vector of correct answers. The correct answers vector will get recycled until all values have been processed. The problem with this method is that the comparison runs down columns rather than across rows. 

This demonstrates the problem. Table \@ref(tab:pat1vector) shows a pattern of "correct" values, and Table \@ref(tab:d1dataframe) shows a table of responses


```r
# make a pattern to match against
pat1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
names(pat1) <- paste("question", 1:4, sep="_")

pat1 %>% 
    t() %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    kable(caption = 'A pattern of "correct" values') %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
<caption>(\#tab:pat1vector)A pattern of "correct" values</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 3 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 4 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


```r
# make a data frame to process
d1 <- cbind(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3), rep(3,3), rep(4, 3)) %>% 
    data.frame()
names(d1) <- names(pat1)

d1 %>% 
    kable(caption = "A table of responses") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">

   <th style="text-align:right;"> question_4 </th>
  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 1 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 3 </td>

   <td style="text-align:right;"> 2 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 3 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 4 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The pattern matches the first row of data (Table \@ref(tab:patmatchonerow))


```r
(pat1 == d1[1,]) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Matches for the first row") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")    
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
<caption>(\#tab:patmatchonerow)Matches for the first row</caption>

  <tr>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The patterns do not match the overall table as might be expected (\@ref(tab:patmatchdfbad)). 


```r
(d1 == pat1) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Unexpected pattern matches") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">

   <td style="text-align:left;"> FALSE </td>

  </tr>
</tbody>

In order to match the pattern to each row, a transpose is required. The following code performs the transpose, pattern match, and re-transpose, with results in \@ref(tab:patmatchdfgood)


```r
# transpose, check for matching and transpose back
(d1 %>% t() == pat1) %>% 
    t() %>% 
    kable(caption = "Expected pattern matches") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")    
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
<caption>(\#tab:patmatchdfgood)Expected pattern matches</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> question_1 </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> question_2 </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> question_3 </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> question_4 </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> TRUE </td>
  </tr>

So the trick is to use a transpose (`t()`) to swap rows and columns. Then `unlist()` will enforce the correct ordering. After running the comparison, the data are transposed again to recreate the original structure.


```r
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()
# transpose and compare
ans_unlist <- mydat %>%
    select(-1) %>% 
    t(.) %>% 
    unlist(.) == correct

# re-transpose and make a data frame
ans_unlist %<>% 
    t(.) %>% 
    data.frame()

# column names
colnames(ans_unlist) <- names(correct)

t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_unlist <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(2)
```

This method took 0.01 s to complete.

Yet another method similarly uses the double transpose method.


```r
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()
# strip the ID column and transpose
z <- mydat %>% 
    select(-1) %>% 
    t() 

# compare, transpose, and make a data frame
ans_tranpose <- (z == correct) %>% 
    t(.) %>% 
    data.frame()

t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_transpose <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(2)
```

This method took 0.01 s to complete.

The final and most direct method uses `base::sweep()`, which can be used to compare a vector against all rows or columns in a data frame. In order to use this function, the data frame needs to have the same number of rows (or columns) as the comparison vector. So any additional rows or columns need to be stripped. Because we may have additional columns (e.g., `aid`), those must be removed before running `sweep()`, then added back in again. Additionally, the result of `sweep()` is a matrix, so it needs to be converted to a data frame for greater functionality.


```r
t0 <- Sys.time()
ans_sweep <- mydat %>%
    # drop the aid column
    select(-aid) %>% 
    # run the sweep
    sweep(x = ., MARGIN = 2, STATS = correct, FUN = "==") %>% 
    # convert to data frame
    data.frame()
t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_sweep <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(3)
```

The `sweep()` method took 0.011 s.

We should check that the methods all gave identical answers.


```r
Vectorize(identical, 'x')(list(ans_loop, ans_adply, ans_tranpose, ans_unlist), ans_loop)
```

```
## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

### Scoring across columns{#scoring-across-columns}
Now that we have a data frame indicating for each participant whether they answered each question correctly, we can total the number of correct answers for each participant. The `rowSums()` function allows sums across rows. Because the logical values are automatically converted to numerical values (TRUE = 1; FALSE = 0), the sums provide the total number of correct answers per participant. Also because the data frame only consists of answers 1 .. 10, we can use an unqualified `rowSums()`, otherwise it would be necessary to specify which columns would be included by either position or column name.

We also bring the subject identifier (`aid`) back in and reorder the columns with `select()`. Note that after the specified `aid` and total `h1kqNa_sum` columns, we can use `everything()` to select the remainder of the columns.


```r
ans_loop %<>%
    # calculate the rowSums
    mutate(h1kqNa_sum = rowSums(.)) %>% 
    # bring the ID back in
    mutate(aid = mydat$aid) %>% 
    # reorder columns
    select(aid, h1kqNa_sum, everything())
```

To show differences in total score by sex, we can join the main data back using the `aid` identifier and create a simple graph. Figure \@ref(fig:hist) shows that more females than males had overall higher counts of correct scores on the Knowledge Quiz. 



```r
ans_loop %<>% 
    left_join(dat, by = "aid") %>% 
    mutate(
        sex = case_when(
            bio_sex == 1 ~ 'male',
            bio_sex == 2 ~ 'female'
        )
    )

ggplot(data = ans_loop, mapping = aes(x = h1kqNa_sum))+
    geom_histogram(stat = "count") +
    facet_grid(sex ~ .) + 
    xlab("correct answers on Knowledge Quiz") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=0:10)
```

## Reordering values
Sometimes variables are provided in the reverse order of what you might want. For example, the answers pertaining to confidence in the Knowledge Quiz are in this specific order:


```r
attributes(dat$h1kq1b)$labels %>% t() %>% t() %>% data.frame()
```

```
##                                    .
## (1) Very                           1
## (2) Moderately                     2
## (3) Slightly                       3
## (4) Not at all                     4
## (6) Refused                        6
## (7) Legitimate skip (less than 15) 7
## (8) Don't know                     8
## (9) Not applicable                 9
```

To come up with a scale score for these, it would be better to have `Very` valued as a `4` and `Not at all` as a `1` so that row-wise sums would yield higher values for those who were more confident in many answers. One could use the existing values, but then the interpretation of an overall confidence score might be difficult, with the most confidence for the lowest overall score.

Changing these values is quite straightforward. The `case_when()` function can be used:


```r
# for comparison, make a backup data frame
datbak <- dat2 <- dat

# reassign values
dat %<>% 
    mutate(h1kq1b = 
               case_when(
                   # main changes
                   h1kq1b == 4 ~ 1,
                   h1kq1b == 3 ~ 2,
                   h1kq1b == 2 ~ 3,
                   h1kq1b == 1 ~ 4,
                   # anything that is not in the above list gets its original value
                   TRUE ~ as.numeric(h1kq1b))
               )
```

It is a bit more awkward to deal with multiple columns. One might be tempted to use a brute force method by copy/paste/edit but using the `mutate_at()` function can help through the use of regular expression pattern matching for column names. The same function will be performed on multiple columns. Here we use a similar regular expression to find the columns representing confidence in answers to the Knowledge Quiz (`h1kq.*b`). The use of the dot (`.`) is shorthand for "the current object" which in this case is the specified column.


```r
dat2 %<>% 
    mutate_at(.vars = vars(matches("h1kq.*b")),
              funs(
                  case_when(
                      . == 4 ~ 1,
                      . == 3 ~ 2,
                      . == 2 ~ 3,
                      . == 1 ~ 4,
                      TRUE ~ as.numeric(.)
                  )
              )
    )
```

For the sake of comparison to show that the single bit of code acted on multiple columns:


```r
orig1 <- table(datbak$h1kq1b) %>% data.frame()

mod1 <- table(dat2$h1kq1b) %>% data.frame()

orig2 <- table(datbak$h1kq2b) %>% data.frame()

mod2 <- table(dat2$h1kq2b) %>% data.frame()

cbind(orig1, mod1, orig2, mod2) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left") %>% 
    add_header_above(rep(c("original" = 2, "modified" = 2), 2)) %>% 
    add_header_above(c("h1kq1b" = 4, "h1kq2b" = 4))
```

<h2>Topic: Add Health data: variable creation and scale scoring</h2>
This week's lesson will provide more background on variable creation and scale scoring. The scale scoring exercise will be used to create a single variable that represents how well respondents did overall on a subset of questions.

## Scale scoring
We will be using data from the Knowledge Quiz. Download or open [21600-0001-Codebook_Questionnaire.pdf](http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/metadata/Wave1_Comprehensive_Codebook/21600-0001-Codebook_Questionnaire.pdf) in a new window or tab and go to page 203, or search for the string `H1KQ1A`.

We will be using the file `AHwave1_v1.dta`, which is downloaded and read in the following code chunk, along with presentation of the column names, labels, and values.

```{r}
dat <- haven::read_dta("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/AHwave1_v1.dta")

metadata <- bind_cols(
    # variable name
    varname = colnames(dat),
    # label
    varlabel = lapply(dat, function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist(),
    # values
    varvalues = lapply(dat, function(x) attributes(x)$labels) %>% 
        # names the variable label vector
        lapply(., function(x) names(x)) %>% 
        # as character
        as.character() %>% 
        # remove the c() construction
        str_remove_all("^c\\(|\\)$")
)

DT::datatable(metadata)
```

Questions `H1KQ1A`, `H1KQ2A`, ..., `H1KQ10A` are factual questions about contraception that are administered to participants $\ge$ age 15. We will be creating a single score that sums up all the correct answers across these questions for each participant $\ge$ age 15. Because the set of questions is paired, with question "a" being the factual portion and "b" being the level of confidence, we want only those questions with column names ending with "a".

### Selecting specific columns
There are several ways of selecting the desired columns into a new data frame. Here is brute force approach:

```{r}
# create a data frame of some columns and age >= 15
mydat_bruteforce <- dat %>% 
    # drop those under 15 y
    filter(h1kq1a != 7) %>% 
    # get answers
    select(
        aid, # subject ID
        h1kq1a,
        h1kq2a,
        h1kq3a,
        h1kq4a,
        h1kq5a,
        h1kq6a,
        h1kq7a,
        h1kq8a,
        h1kq9a,
        h1kq10a
    )
```

Although there were only 10 columns with this name pattern, what if there had been 30 or 50? You would not want to have to enter each column name separately. Not only would this be tedious, there would always be the possibility of making a keyboarding mistake.

Instead of the brute force approach, we can use the `matches()` function with a regular expression. The regular expression here is `^h1kq.*a$`, which translates to "at the start of the string, match `h1kq`, then any number of any characters, then `a` followed by the end of the string".

```{r}
mydat <- dat %>% 
    filter(h1kq1a != 7) %>% 
    select(
        aid,
        matches("h1kq.*a")
    )
```

We check that both processes yielded the same result:

```{r}
identical(mydat_bruteforce, mydat)
```

### Comparing participant answers to correct answers

Now that we have a data frame limited to the participants in the correct age range and only the questions we want, we need to set up tests for whether the questions were answered correctly or not. From the metadata we can see that for some questions, the correct answer was `(1) true` and for some, the correct answer was `(2) false`.

We can scan through the questions in the metadata to create a vector of correct answers:

```{r}
# the correct answers
correct <- c(2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2) 
# make a named vector of the answers using the selected column names
names(correct) <- str_subset(string = names(mydat),
                             pattern = "h1kq.*a")
```

What we now need to do is compare this vector to a vector constructed of the answers in `mydat`. There are a few approaches that could be taken. A brute force approach could use a loop to iterate over each record in the answers, and for each record to iterate over each answer:

```{r}
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()

# make an output
ans_loop <- NULL

# iterate over rows
#testing:
#for(i in 1:3){ 
for(i in 1:nrow(mydat)){
    # init a vector
    Q <- NULL
    # iterate over columns, ignoring the first "aid" column
    for(j in 2:ncol(mydat)){
        # get the value of the answer
        ans_subj <- mydat[i, j]
        # get the correct answer
        ans_actual <- correct[j - 1]
        # compare
        cmp <- ans_actual == ans_subj
        # append
        Q <- c(Q, cmp)
    }
    # append
    ans_loop <- rbind(ans_loop, Q)
}

# package it up nicely
ans_loop %<>% data.frame()
colnames(ans_loop) <- names(correct)
row.names(ans_loop) <- NULL

# timing
t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_loop <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(1)
```

It took `r runtime_loop` s to run. This low performance is because the algorithm is visiting every cell and comparing one-by-on with a rotating value for the correct answer from the vector of correct answers. Each object is required to be handled separately in RAM as the process continues.

Another approach uses `plyr::adply()`, which runs a function over a set of rows. The [`plyr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plyr/) package contains a set of tools for splitting data, applying functions, and recombining.

```{r}
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()

ans_adply <- mydat %>% 
    select(-1) %>% 
    plyr::adply(.margins = 1, 
                function(x) x == correct)

t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_adply <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(1)
```

The `adply()` version takes far less coding, but still took `r runtime_adply` s to run.

Yet another different approach compares the data frame of participant answers to the vector of correct answers. The correct answers vector will get recycled until all values have been processed. The problem with this method is that the comparison runs down columns rather than across rows. 

This demonstrates the problem. Table \@ref(tab:pat1vector) shows a pattern of "correct" values, and Table \@ref(tab:d1dataframe) shows a table of responses

```{r pat1vector}
# make a pattern to match against
pat1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
names(pat1) <- paste("question", 1:4, sep="_")

pat1 %>% 
    t() %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    kable(caption = 'A pattern of "correct" values') %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

```{r d1dataframe}
# make a data frame to process
d1 <- cbind(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3), rep(3,3), rep(4, 3)) %>% 
    data.frame()
names(d1) <- names(pat1)

d1 %>% 
    kable(caption = "A table of responses") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

The pattern matches the first row of data (Table \@ref(tab:patmatchonerow))

```{r patmatchonerow}
(pat1 == d1[1,]) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Matches for the first row") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")    
```

The patterns do not match the overall table as might be expected (\@ref(tab:patmatchdfbad)). 

```{r patmatchdfbad}
(d1 == pat1) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Unexpected pattern matches") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

In order to match the pattern to each row, a transpose is required. The following code performs the transpose, pattern match, and re-transpose, with results in \@ref(tab:patmatchdfgood)

```{r patmatchdfgood}
# transpose, check for matching and transpose back
(d1 %>% t() == pat1) %>% 
    t() %>% 
    kable(caption = "Expected pattern matches") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")    
```

So the trick is to use a transpose (`t()`) to swap rows and columns. Then `unlist()` will enforce the correct ordering. After running the comparison, the data are transposed again to recreate the original structure.

```{r}
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()
# transpose and compare
ans_unlist <- mydat %>%
    select(-1) %>% 
    t(.) %>% 
    unlist(.) == correct

# re-transpose and make a data frame
ans_unlist %<>% 
    t(.) %>% 
    data.frame()

# column names
colnames(ans_unlist) <- names(correct)

t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_unlist <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(2)
```

This method took `r runtime_unlist` s to complete.

Yet another method similarly uses the double transpose method.

```{r}
# time this
t0 <- Sys.time()
# strip the ID column and transpose
z <- mydat %>% 
    select(-1) %>% 
    t() 

# compare, transpose, and make a data frame
ans_tranpose <- (z == correct) %>% 
    t(.) %>% 
    data.frame()

t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_transpose <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(2)
```

This method took `r runtime_transpose` s to complete.

The final and most direct method uses `base::sweep()`, which can be used to compare a vector against all rows or columns in a data frame. In order to use this function, the data frame needs to have the same number of rows (or columns) as the comparison vector. So any additional rows or columns need to be stripped. Because we may have additional columns (e.g., `aid`), those must be removed before running `sweep()`, then added back in again. Additionally, the result of `sweep()` is a matrix, so it needs to be converted to a data frame for greater functionality.

```{r}
t0 <- Sys.time()
ans_sweep <- mydat %>%
    # drop the aid column
    select(-aid) %>% 
    # run the sweep
    sweep(x = ., MARGIN = 2, STATS = correct, FUN = "==") %>% 
    # convert to data frame
    data.frame()
t1 <- Sys.time()
runtime_sweep <- difftime(t1, t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric() %>% round(3)
```

The `sweep()` method took `r runtime_sweep` s.

We should check that the methods all gave identical answers.

```{r}
Vectorize(identical, 'x')(list(ans_loop, ans_adply, ans_tranpose, ans_unlist), ans_loop)
```

### Scoring across columns{#scoring-across-columns}
Now that we have a data frame indicating for each participant whether they answered each question correctly, we can total the number of correct answers for each participant. The `rowSums()` function allows sums across rows. Because the logical values are automatically converted to numerical values (TRUE = 1; FALSE = 0), the sums provide the total number of correct answers per participant. Also because the data frame only consists of answers 1 .. 10, we can use an unqualified `rowSums()`, otherwise it would be necessary to specify which columns would be included by either position or column name.

We also bring the subject identifier (`aid`) back in and reorder the columns with `select()`. Note that after the specified `aid` and total `h1kqNa_sum` columns, we can use `everything()` to select the remainder of the columns.

```{r}
ans_loop %<>%
    # calculate the rowSums
    mutate(h1kqNa_sum = rowSums(.)) %>% 
    # bring the ID back in
    mutate(aid = mydat$aid) %>% 
    # reorder columns
    select(aid, h1kqNa_sum, everything())
```

To show differences in total score by sex, we can join the main data back using the `aid` identifier and create a simple graph. Figure \@ref(fig:hist) shows that more females than males had overall higher counts of correct scores on the Knowledge Quiz. 

```{r hist, fig.cap="Histogram of count of correct answers on Knowledge Quiz stratified by sex of respondent"}
ans_loop %<>% 
    left_join(dat, by = "aid") %>% 
    mutate(
        sex = case_when(
            bio_sex == 1 ~ 'male',
            bio_sex == 2 ~ 'female'
        )
    )

ggplot(data = ans_loop, mapping = aes(x = h1kqNa_sum))+
    geom_histogram(stat = "count") +
    facet_grid(sex ~ .) + 
    xlab("correct answers on Knowledge Quiz") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=0:10)
```


## Reordering values
Sometimes variables are provided in the reverse order of what you might want. For example, the answers pertaining to confidence in the Knowledge Quiz are in this specific order:

```{r}
attributes(dat$h1kq1b)$labels %>% t() %>% t() %>% data.frame()
```

To come up with a scale score for these, it would be better to have `Very` valued as a `4` and `Not at all` as a `1` so that row-wise sums would yield higher values for those who were more confident in many answers. One could use the existing values, but then the interpretation of an overall confidence score might be difficult, with the most confidence for the lowest overall score.

Changing these values is quite straightforward. The `case_when()` function can be used:

```{r}
# for comparison, make a backup data frame
datbak <- dat2 <- dat

# reassign values
dat %<>% 
    mutate(h1kq1b = 
               case_when(
                   # main changes
                   h1kq1b == 4 ~ 1,
                   h1kq1b == 3 ~ 2,
                   h1kq1b == 2 ~ 3,
                   h1kq1b == 1 ~ 4,
                   # anything that is not in the above list gets its original value
                   TRUE ~ as.numeric(h1kq1b))
               )
```

It is a bit more awkward to deal with multiple columns. One might be tempted to use a brute force method by copy/paste/edit but using the `mutate_at()` function can help through the use of regular expression pattern matching for column names. The same function will be performed on multiple columns. Here we use a similar regular expression to find the columns representing confidence in answers to the Knowledge Quiz (`h1kq.*b`). The use of the dot (`.`) is shorthand for "the current object" which in this case is the specified column.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
dat2 %<>% 
    mutate_at(.vars = vars(matches("h1kq.*b")),
              funs(
                  case_when(
                      . == 4 ~ 1,
                      . == 3 ~ 2,
                      . == 2 ~ 3,
                      . == 1 ~ 4,
                      TRUE ~ as.numeric(.)
                  )
              )
    )
```

For the sake of comparison to show that the single bit of code acted on multiple columns:

```{r}
orig1 <- table(datbak$h1kq1b) %>% data.frame()

mod1 <- table(dat2$h1kq1b) %>% data.frame()

orig2 <- table(datbak$h1kq2b) %>% data.frame()

mod2 <- table(dat2$h1kq2b) %>% data.frame()

cbind(orig1, mod1, orig2, mod2) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left") %>% 
    add_header_above(rep(c("original" = 2, "modified" = 2), 2)) %>% 
    add_header_above(c("h1kq1b" = 4, "h1kq2b" = 4))

# too many unique combinations!
# dat2 %>% 
#     group_by_at(vars(matches("h1kq.*b"))) %>% 
#     dplyr::summarise(n = n())
```

Now that the values are reordered, they can be used in multiple-column scale scoring as demonstrated above.

<h2>Topic: Miscellaneous data processing </h2>
This week's lesson will cover a set of miscellaneous data processing topics.

Mostly this is a set of coded examples with explanations

## Substituting text

### `paste()`, `paste0()`

Pasting text allows you to substitute variables within a text string. For example, if you are running a long loop over a series of files and you want to know which file name and loop iteration you are on. 

The function `paste()` combines a set of strings and adds a space between the strings, e.g., combining the first values from the `LETTERS` and the `letters` built-in vectors:


```r
paste(LETTERS[1], letters[1])
```

```
## [1] "A a"
```

whereas `paste0` does not add spaces:


```r
paste0(LETTERS[1], letters[1])
```

```
## [1] "Aa"
```

The code below uses the function `tempdir()` to specify a folder that is automatically generated per R session; for this rendering of the book, the location was C:\Temp\15\RtmpYz5x9D but will almost certainly be different for your session. The code downloads and unzips the file [quickfox](files/quickfox.zip) to the `tempdir()` location. The zip file contains a separate file for each word in the phrase "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". The code then uses a loop and `paste()` to show the contents of each separate file along with its file name.


```r
# zip file
zipfile <- file.path(tempdir(), "quickfox.zip")

# download
curl_download(url = "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/files/quickfox.zip", destfile = zipfile)

# unzip
unzip(zipfile = zipfile, overwrite = TRUE, exdir = tempdir())

# files in the zip file
fnames <- unzip(zipfile = file.path(tempdir(), "quickfox.zip"), list = TRUE) %>%
    pull(Name) %>%
    file.path(tempdir(), .)

# read each file
for (i in seq_len(length(fnames))) {
    # the file name with a forward slash
    fname <- fnames[i] %>% normalizePath(winslash = "/")
    # read the file
    mytext <- scan(file = fname, what = "character", quiet = TRUE)

    # vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    # make a string using `paste()`
    mystr <- paste(mytext, "    ", i, "of", length(fnames), fname)
    # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    # print the message
    message(mystr)
}
```

### `sprintf()`
`sprintf()` can be used to format text. Here are just a few examples. The result is a formatted text string.

#### Formatting numerical values
<u>Leading zeros</u>

Numeric values can be formatted with a specific number of decimal places or leading zeros. For example, ZIP codes imported from CSV files often are converted to integers. The following code chunk converts some numerical ZIP code-like values to text values with the correct format.

Bad ZIP codes:

```r
# some numerical ZIP codes
(zip_bad <- data.frame(id = 1:3, zipcode = c(90201, 02134, 00501)))
```

```
##   id zipcode
## 1  1   90201
## 2  2    2134
## 3  3     501
```

Good ZIP codes:

```r
# fix them up
(zip_good <- zip_bad %>% mutate(
    zipcode = sprintf("%05d", zipcode)
))
```

```
##   id zipcode
## 1  1   90201
## 2  2   02134
## 3  3   00501
```

<u>Decimal places</u>

Numerical values with different numbers of decimal places can be rendered with a specific number of decimal places. 


```r
# numbers with a variety of decimal places
v <- c(1.2, 2.345, 1e+5 + 00005)

# four fixed decimal places
v %>% sprintf("%0.4f", .)
```

```
## [1] "1.2000"      "2.3450"      "100005.0000"
```

Note that this is distinct from `round()`, which results in a numeric vector:


```r
# round to 4 places
v %>% round(., 4)
```

```
## [1]      1.200      2.345 100005.000
```

#### String substitutions
`sprintf()` can also be used to achieve the same substitution in the file reading loop above. Each `%s` is substituted in order of the position of the arguments following the string. Also note that `\t` inserts a `TAB` character.


```r
# read each file
for (i in seq_len(length(fnames))) {
    # the file name
    fname <- fnames[i]
    # read the file
    mytext <- scan(file = fname, what = "character", quiet = TRUE)

    # vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    # make a string using `paste()`
    mystr <- sprintf("%s\t%s of %s:\t%s", mytext, i, length(fnames), fname)
    # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    # print the message
    cat(mystr)
}
```

```

```

### `str_replace()`, `str_replace_all()`
The `stringr` functions `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` can be used to substitute specific strings in other strings. For example, we might create a generic function to run over a set of subject IDs that generates a file for each subject.


```r
subjects <- c("a1", "b2", "c3")

f <- function(id) {
    # create an output file name by substituting in the subject ID
    outfname <- file.path(tempdir(), "xIDx.csv") %>% str_replace(pattern = "xIDx", id)
    # ... do a bunch of stuff, for example
    val <- rnorm(1)
    # write the file
    message(paste0("writing"))
    write.csv(x = val, file = outfname)
}

for (i in subjects) {
    f(i)
}
```

```
## writing
## writing
## writing
```

## Showing progress
A text-based progress bar can be shown using `txtProgressBar()`. Here we run the same loop for reading the text files, but rather than printing the loop iteration and file names, we show the progress bar and the file contents. If no text is printed to the console (unlike what is demonstrated below with `cat()`), the progress bar will not print on several lines.


```r
n_fnames <- length(fnames)
# create progress bar
pb <- txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = n_fnames, style = 3)
```

```

## Turning text into code: `eval(parse(text = "some string"))`
Sometimes you may have variables whose values that you want to use in a command or function. For example, suppose you wanted to write a set of files, one for each ZIP code in a data frame, with a file name including the ZIP code. We would not want to use the column name `zipcode`, but we want the actual value. 

We can generate a command using some kind of text substitution as above with `sprintf()`


```r
for (i in zip_good %>% pull(zipcode)) {
    # do some stuff
    vals <- rnorm(n = 3)
    y <- bind_cols(zipcode = i, v = vals)
    # a writing command using sprintf() to substitute %s = ZIP code
    cmd <- sprintf("write.csv(x = y, file = file.path(tempdir(), '%s.csv'), row.names = FALSE)", i)

    # this runs the command
    eval(parse(text = cmd))
}
```

## SQL in R with `RSQLite` and `sqldf`
Sometimes R's syntax for processing data can be difficult and confusing. For programmers who are familiar with structured query language (SQL), it is possible to run SQL statements within R using a supported database back end (by default SQLite) and the `sqldf()` function.

For example, the mean sepal length by species from the built-in `iris` data set can be obtained, presented in Table \@ref(tab:iris)


```r
library(sqldf)
```

```
## Loading required package: gsubfn
```

```
## Loading required package: proto
```

```
## Loading required package: RSQLite
```

```r
sqlc <- 'select
    "Species" as species
    , avg("Sepal.Length") as mean_sepal_length
from iris
group by "Species";
'

iris_summary <- sqldf(x = sqlc)

iris_summary %>%
    kable(caption = "Mean sepal length from the iris data set") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; ">
<caption>(\#tab:iris)Mean sepal length from the iris data set</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> species </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> mean_sepal_length </th>

## Downloading files from password-protected web sites
Some web sites are protected by simple username/password protection. For example, try opening [http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected] (http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected). The username/password pair is csde/502, which will allow you to see the contents of the web folder.

If you try downloading the file through R, you will get an error because no password is supplied.


```r
try(
    read.csv("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected/foo.csv")
)
```

```
## Warning in file(file, "rt"): cannot open URL 'http://staff.washington.edu/
## phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected/foo.csv': HTTP status was '401
## Unauthorized'
```

```
## Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
```

However, the username and password can be supplied as part of the URL, as below. When the username and password are supplied, they will be cached for that site for the duration of the R session.


```r
try(
    read.csv("http://csde:502@staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected/foo.csv")
)
```

```
## Warning in file(file, "rt"): cannot open URL 'http://
## csde:502@staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected/
## foo.csv': HTTP status was '401 Unauthorized'
```

```
## Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
```


## Dates and time stamps: `POSIXct` and `lubridate`
R uses POSIX-style time stamps, which are stored internally as the number of fractional seconds from January 1, 1970. It is imperative that the control over time stamps is commensurate with the temporal accuracy and precision  your data. For example, in the measurement of years of residence, precision is not substantially important. For measurement of chemical reactions, fractional seconds may be very important. For applications such as merging body-worn sensor data from GPS units and accelerometers for estimating where and when physical activity occurs, minutes of error can result in statistically significant mis-estimations.

For example, you can see the numeric value of these seconds as `options(digits = 22); Sys.time() %>% as.numeric()`.


```r
options(digits = 22)
Sys.time() %>% as.numeric()
```

```
## [1] 1641435669.4815259
```

If you have time stamps in text format, they can be converted to POSIX time stamps, e.g., the supposed time Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon:


```r
(eagle <- as.POSIXct(x = "7/20/69 10:56 PM", tz = "CST6CDT", format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
```

```
## [1] "1969-07-20 10:56:00 CDT"
```

Formats can be specified using specific codes, see `strptime()`.

The `lubridate` package has a large number of functions for handling date and time stamps. For example, if you want to convert a time stamp in the current time zone to a different time zone, first we get the current time


```r
library(lubridate)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'lubridate'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     date, intersect, setdiff, union
```

```r
# set the option for fractional seconds
options(digits.secs = 3)
(now <- Sys.time() %>% strptime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS"))
```

```
## [1] "2022-01-05 18:21:09.552 PST"
```

And convert to UTC:


```r
# show this at time zone UTC
(with_tz(time = now, tzone = "UTC"))
```

```
## [1] "2022-01-06 02:21:09.552 UTC"
```

or show in a different format:


```r
# in different format
now %>% format("%A, %B %d, %Y %l:%m %p %Z")
```

```
## [1] "Wednesday, January 05, 2022  6:01 PM PST"
```



## Timing with `Sys.time()` and `difftime()`
It is easy to determine how long a process takes by using sequential `Sys.time()` calls, one before and one after the process, and getting the difference with `difftime()`. For example, 


```r
# mark time and run a process
t0 <- Sys.time()
Sys.sleep(5)
t1 <- Sys.time()

# difftime() unqualified will make its best decision about what to print
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0))
```

```
## Time difference of 5.004138 secs
```

```r
# time between moon step and now-ish
(difftime(time1 = t0, time2 = eagle))
```

```
## Time difference of 19162.43 days
```

`difftime()` can also be forced to report the time difference in the units of choice:


```r
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(0)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "mins") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(2)
```

```
## [1] 0.08
```

```r
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "hours") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(4)
```

```
## [1] 0.0014
```

```r
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "days") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(6)
```

```
## [1] 5.8e-05
```

## Faster files with `fst()`
The `fst` package is great for rapid reading and writing of data frames. The format can also result in much smaller file sizes using compression. Here we will examine the large Add Health file. First, a download, unzip, and read as necessary:


```r
library(fst)
myUrl <- "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip"
# zip file in $temp
zipfile <- file.path(tempdir(), basename(myUrl))
# download
curl_download(url = myUrl, destfile = zipfile)
# dta file in $temp
dtafname <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(zipfile)
# check if the dta file exists
if (!file.exists(dtafname)) {
    # if the dta file doesn't exist, check for the zip file
    # check if the zip file exists, download if necessary
    if (!file.exists(zipfile)) {
        curl::curl_download(url = myUrl, destfile = zipfile)
    }
    # unzip the downloaded zip file
    unzip(zipfile = zipfile, exdir = tempdir())
}

# read the file
dat <- read_dta(dtafname)

# save as a CSV, along with timing
t0 <- Sys.time()
csvfname <- dtafname %>% str_replace(pattern = "dta", replacement = "csv")
write.csv(x = dat, file = csvfname, row.names = FALSE)
t1 <- Sys.time()
csvwrite_time <- difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "secs") %>%
    as.numeric() %>%
    round(1)

# file size
csvsize <- file.info(csvfname) %>%
    pull(size) %>%
    sprintf("%0.f", .)

# save as FST, along with timing
t0 <- Sys.time()
fstfname <- dtafname %>% str_replace(pattern = "dta", replacement = "fst")
write.fst(x = dat, path = fstfname)
t1 <- Sys.time()

# file size
fstsize <- file.info(fstfname) %>%
    pull(size) %>%
    sprintf("%0.f", .)
fstwrite_time <- difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "secs") %>%
    as.numeric() %>%
    round(1)
```

It took 30.6 s to write 41823590 bytes as CSV, and 0.2 s to write 19064839 bytes as a FST file (with the default compression amount of 50). Reading speeds are comparable.

___It should be noted___ that some file attributes will not be saved in FST format and therefore it should be used with caution if you have a highly attributed data set (e.g., a Stata DTA file with extensive labeling). You will lose those attributes! But for data sets with a simple structure, including factors, the FST format is a good option.

## Load US Census Boundary and Attribute Data as 'tidyverse' and 'sf'-Ready Data Frames: `tigris`, `tidycensus`
Dealing with US Census data can be overwhelming, particularly if using the raw text-based data. The Census Bureau has an API that allows more streamlined downloads of variables (as data frames) and geographies (as simple format shapes). It is necessary to get an API key, available for free. See [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) and  [tidycensus basic usage](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html).

`tidycensus` uses [`tigris`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tigris/versions/1.0), which downloads the geographic data portion of the census files.

### Download data
A simple example will download the variables representing the count of White, Black/African American, American Indian/Native American, and Asian persons from the American Community Survey (ACS) data for King County in 2019. For this example to run, you need to have your US Census API key installed, e.g., 

<tt>
tidycensus::census_api_key("*****************", install = TRUE)<br>
<font color="red">
Your API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY").<br>
To use now, restart R or run `readRenviron("~/.Renviron")`
</font>
</tt>

The labels from the census API are:

```
"Estimate!!Total"                                         
"Estimate!!Total!!White alone"                            
"Estimate!!Total!!Black or African American alone"        
"Estimate!!Total!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone"
"Estimate!!Total!!Asian alone" 
```


```r
library(tidycensus)
# the census variables
census_vars <- c(
    p_denom_race = "B02001_001",
    p_n_white = "B02001_002",
    p_n_afram = "B02001_003",
    p_n_aian = "B02001_004",
    p_n_asian = "B02001_005"
)

# get the data
ctdat <- get_acs(
    geography = "tract",
    variables = census_vars,
    cache_table = TRUE,
    year = 2019,
    output = "wide",
    state = "WA",
    county = "King",
    geometry = TRUE,
    survey = "acs5"
)
```

## Easier regular expressions with `RVerbalExpressions`
Regular expressions are powerful but take some time and trial-and-error to master. The `RVerbalExpresions` package can be used to more easily generate regular expressions. See the help for `rx()` and associated functions.

These examples show two constructions of regular expressions for matching two similar but different URLs.


```r
library(RVerbalExpressions)
# a pattern
x <- rx_start_of_line() %>%
    rx_find("http") %>%
    rx_maybe("s") %>%
    rx_find("://") %>%
    rx_maybe("www.") %>%
    rx_anything_but(" ") %>%
    rx_end_of_line()

# print the expression
(x)
```

```
## [1] "^(http)(s)?(\\://)(www\\.)?([^ ]*)$"
```

```r
# search for a pattern in some URLs
urls <- c(
    "http://www.google.com",
    "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/"
)
grepl(pattern = x, x = urls)
```

```
## [1] TRUE TRUE
```

```r
# a different pattern
y <- rx_start_of_line() %>%
    rx_find("http") %>%
    rx_maybe("s") %>%
    rx_find("://") %>%
    rx_find("www.") %>%
    rx_anything_but(" ") %>%
    rx_end_of_line()

# print the expression
(y)
```

```
## [1] "^(http)(s)?(\\://)(www\\.)([^ ]*)$"
```

```r
# search for a pattern in the two URLs, matches one, does not match the other
grepl(pattern = y, x = urls)
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

## Quick copy from Excel (Windows only)
Under Windows, it is possible to copy selected cells from an Excel worksheet directly to R. This is not an endorsement for using Excel, but there are some cases in which Excel may be able to produce some quick data that you don't want to develop in other ways.

As a demonstration, you can use [analysis.xlsx](files/words_analysis.xlsx). Download and open the file. Here is shown a selection of cells that was copied. 

![](images/week09/excel.png)

The code below shows how the data can be copied.




```r
xlsclip <- read.table(file = "clipboard", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

xlsclip %>%
    kable() %>%
    kable_styling(
        full_width = FALSE,
        position = "left"
    )
```

## Running system commands
R can run arbitrary system commands that you would normally run in a terminal or command window. The `system()` function is used to run commands, optionally with the results returned as a character vector. Under Mac and Linux, the usage is quite straightforward, for example, to list files in a specific directory:

```
tempdirfiles <- system("ls C:\Temp\15\RtmpYz5x9D", intern = TRUE)
```

Under Windows, it takes a bit of extra code. To do the same requires the prefix `cmd /c` in the `system()` call before the command itself. Also any backslashes in path names need to be specified as double-backslashes for R.


```r
# R prefers and automatically generates forward slashes
tmpdir <- dirname(tempdir())

# OS
os <- .Platform$OS.type

# construct a system command
# under Windows
if (os == "windows") {
    # under Windows, path delimiters are backslashes so need to be rendered in R as double backslashes
    tmpdir %<>% str_replace_all("/", "\\\\")
    cmd <- sprintf("cmd /c dir %s", tmpdir)
    tempdirfiles <- system(command = cmd, intern = TRUE)
}

# under *NIX
if (os == "unix") {
    cmd <- sprintf("ls %s", tmpdir)
    tempdirfiles <- system(command = cmd, intern = TRUE)
}
```

If you are running other programs or utilities that are executed in a terminal or command window, this can be very helpful.

## Code styling
Good code should meet at least the two functional requirements of getting the job done and being able able to read. Code that gets the job done but that is not easy to read will cause problems later when you try to figure out how or why you did something.

The [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package can help clean up your code so that it conforms to a specific style such as that in the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). `styler` can be integrated into RStudio for interactive use. It can reformat selected code, an entire file, or an entire project. An example is shown:

![](images/week09/styler_0.1.gif)

[`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) is also useful for identifying potential style errors.

## Session information
It may be helpful in troubleshooting or complete documentation to report the complete session information. For example, sometimes outdated versions of packages may contain errors. The session information is printed with `sessionInfo()`.


```r
sessionInfo()
```

<h2>Topic: Miscellaneous data processing </h2>
This week's lesson will cover a set of miscellaneous data processing topics.

Mostly this is a set of coded examples with explanations

## Substituting text

### `paste()`, `paste0()`

Pasting text allows you to substitute variables within a text string. For example, if you are running a long loop over a series of files and you want to know which file name and loop iteration you are on. 

The function `paste()` combines a set of strings and adds a space between the strings, e.g., combining the first values from the `LETTERS` and the `letters` built-in vectors:

```{r}
paste(LETTERS[1], letters[1])
```

whereas `paste0` does not add spaces:

```{r}
paste0(LETTERS[1], letters[1])
```

The code below uses the function `tempdir()` to specify a folder that is automatically generated per R session; for this rendering of the book, the location was `r tempdir()` but will almost certainly be different for your session. The code downloads and unzips the file [quickfox](files/quickfox.zip) to the `tempdir()` location. The zip file contains a separate file for each word in the phrase "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". The code then uses a loop and `paste()` to show the contents of each separate file along with its file name.

```{r}
# zip file
zipfile <- file.path(tempdir(), "quickfox.zip")

# download
curl_download(url = "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/files/quickfox.zip", destfile = zipfile)

# unzip
unzip(zipfile = zipfile, overwrite = TRUE, exdir = tempdir())

# files in the zip file
fnames <- unzip(zipfile = file.path(tempdir(), "quickfox.zip"), list = TRUE) %>%
    pull(Name) %>%
    file.path(tempdir(), .)

# read each file
for (i in seq_len(length(fnames))) {
    # the file name with a forward slash
    fname <- fnames[i] %>% normalizePath(winslash = "/")
    # read the file
    mytext <- scan(file = fname, what = "character", quiet = TRUE)

    # vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    # make a string using `paste()`
    mystr <- paste(mytext, "    ", i, "of", length(fnames), fname)
    # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    # print the message
    message(mystr)
}
```


### `sprintf()`
`sprintf()` can be used to format text. Here are just a few examples. The result is a formatted text string.

#### Formatting numerical values
<u>Leading zeros</u>

Numeric values can be formatted with a specific number of decimal places or leading zeros. For example, ZIP codes imported from CSV files often are converted to integers. The following code chunk converts some numerical ZIP code-like values to text values with the correct format.

Bad ZIP codes:
```{r}
# some numerical ZIP codes
(zip_bad <- data.frame(id = 1:3, zipcode = c(90201, 02134, 00501)))
```

Good ZIP codes:
```{r}
# fix them up
(zip_good <- zip_bad %>% mutate(
    zipcode = sprintf("%05d", zipcode)
))
```

<u>Decimal places</u>

Numerical values with different numbers of decimal places can be rendered with a specific number of decimal places. 

```{r}
# numbers with a variety of decimal places
v <- c(1.2, 2.345, 1e+5 + 00005)

# four fixed decimal places
v %>% sprintf("%0.4f", .)
```

Note that this is distinct from `round()`, which results in a numeric vector:

```{r}
# round to 4 places
v %>% round(., 4)
```

#### String substitutions
`sprintf()` can also be used to achieve the same substitution in the file reading loop above. Each `%s` is substituted in order of the position of the arguments following the string. Also note that `\t` inserts a `TAB` character.

```{r}
# read each file
for (i in seq_len(length(fnames))) {
    # the file name
    fname <- fnames[i]
    # read the file
    mytext <- scan(file = fname, what = "character", quiet = TRUE)

    # vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    # make a string using `paste()`
    mystr <- sprintf("%s\t%s of %s:\t%s", mytext, i, length(fnames), fname)
    # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    # print the message
    cat(mystr)
}
```

### `str_replace()`, `str_replace_all()`
The `stringr` functions `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` can be used to substitute specific strings in other strings. For example, we might create a generic function to run over a set of subject IDs that generates a file for each subject.

```{r}
subjects <- c("a1", "b2", "c3")

f <- function(id) {
    # create an output file name by substituting in the subject ID
    outfname <- file.path(tempdir(), "xIDx.csv") %>% str_replace(pattern = "xIDx", id)
    # ... do a bunch of stuff, for example
    val <- rnorm(1)
    # write the file
    message(paste0("writing"))
    write.csv(x = val, file = outfname)
}

for (i in subjects) {
    f(i)
}
```

## Showing progress
A text-based progress bar can be shown using `txtProgressBar()`. Here we run the same loop for reading the text files, but rather than printing the loop iteration and file names, we show the progress bar and the file contents. If no text is printed to the console (unlike what is demonstrated below with `cat()`), the progress bar will not print on several lines.

```{r}
n_fnames <- length(fnames)
# create progress bar
pb <- txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = n_fnames, style = 3)
for (i in 1:n_fnames) {
    # delay a bit
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    # update progress bar
    setTxtProgressBar(pb, i)
    # read and print from the file
    txt <- scan(fnames[i], what = "character", quiet = TRUE)
    cat("\n", txt, "\n")
}
close(pb)
```

## Turning text into code: `eval(parse(text = "some string"))`
Sometimes you may have variables whose values that you want to use in a command or function. For example, suppose you wanted to write a set of files, one for each ZIP code in a data frame, with a file name including the ZIP code. We would not want to use the column name `zipcode`, but we want the actual value. 

We can generate a command using some kind of text substitution as above with `sprintf()`

```{r}
for (i in zip_good %>% pull(zipcode)) {
    # do some stuff
    vals <- rnorm(n = 3)
    y <- bind_cols(zipcode = i, v = vals)
    # a writing command using sprintf() to substitute %s = ZIP code
    cmd <- sprintf("write.csv(x = y, file = file.path(tempdir(), '%s.csv'), row.names = FALSE)", i)

    # this runs the command
    eval(parse(text = cmd))
}
```

## SQL in R with `RSQLite` and `sqldf`
Sometimes R's syntax for processing data can be difficult and confusing. For programmers who are familiar with structured query language (SQL), it is possible to run SQL statements within R using a supported database back end (by default SQLite) and the `sqldf()` function.

For example, the mean sepal length by species from the built-in `iris` data set can be obtained, presented in Table \@ref(tab:iris)

```{r iris}
library(sqldf)

sqlc <- 'select
    "Species" as species
    , avg("Sepal.Length") as mean_sepal_length
from iris
group by "Species";
'

iris_summary <- sqldf(x = sqlc)

iris_summary %>%
    kable(caption = "Mean sepal length from the iris data set") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```




## Downloading files from password-protected web sites
Some web sites are protected by simple username/password protection. For example, try opening [http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected] (http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected). The username/password pair is csde/502, which will allow you to see the contents of the web folder.

If you try downloading the file through R, you will get an error because no password is supplied.

```{r}
try(
    read.csv("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected/foo.csv")
)
```

However, the username and password can be supplied as part of the URL, as below. When the username and password are supplied, they will be cached for that site for the duration of the R session.

```{r}
try(
    read.csv("http://csde:502@staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/password_protected/foo.csv")
)
```


## Dates and time stamps: `POSIXct` and `lubridate`
R uses POSIX-style time stamps, which are stored internally as the number of fractional seconds from January 1, 1970. It is imperative that the control over time stamps is commensurate with the temporal accuracy and precision  your data. For example, in the measurement of years of residence, precision is not substantially important. For measurement of chemical reactions, fractional seconds may be very important. For applications such as merging body-worn sensor data from GPS units and accelerometers for estimating where and when physical activity occurs, minutes of error can result in statistically significant mis-estimations.

For example, you can see the numeric value of these seconds as `options(digits = 22); Sys.time() %>% as.numeric()`.

```{r}
options(digits = 22)
Sys.time() %>% as.numeric()
```

If you have time stamps in text format, they can be converted to POSIX time stamps, e.g., the supposed time Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon:

```{r}
(eagle <- as.POSIXct(x = "7/20/69 10:56 PM", tz = "CST6CDT", format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"))
```

Formats can be specified using specific codes, see `strptime()`.

The `lubridate` package has a large number of functions for handling date and time stamps. For example, if you want to convert a time stamp in the current time zone to a different time zone, first we get the current time

```{r}
library(lubridate)
# set the option for fractional seconds
options(digits.secs = 3)
(now <- Sys.time() %>% strptime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS"))
```

And convert to UTC:

```{r}
# show this at time zone UTC
(with_tz(time = now, tzone = "UTC"))
```

or show in a different format:

```{r}
# in different format
now %>% format("%A, %B %d, %Y %l:%m %p %Z")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# reset the digits
options(digits = 7)
```

## Timing with `Sys.time()` and `difftime()`
It is easy to determine how long a process takes by using sequential `Sys.time()` calls, one before and one after the process, and getting the difference with `difftime()`. For example, 

```{r}
# mark time and run a process
t0 <- Sys.time()
Sys.sleep(5)
t1 <- Sys.time()

# difftime() unqualified will make its best decision about what to print
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0))

# time between moon step and now-ish
(difftime(time1 = t0, time2 = eagle))
```

`difftime()` can also be forced to report the time difference in the units of choice:

```{r}
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "secs") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(0)
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "mins") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(2)
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "hours") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(4)
(difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "days") %>% as.numeric()) %>% round(6)
```

## Faster files with `fst()`
The `fst` package is great for rapid reading and writing of data frames. The format can also result in much smaller file sizes using compression. Here we will examine the large Add Health file. First, a download, unzip, and read as necessary:

```{r}
library(fst)
myUrl <- "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/21600-0001-Data.dta.zip"
# zip file in $temp
zipfile <- file.path(tempdir(), basename(myUrl))
# download
curl_download(url = myUrl, destfile = zipfile)
# dta file in $temp
dtafname <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(zipfile)
# check if the dta file exists
if (!file.exists(dtafname)) {
    # if the dta file doesn't exist, check for the zip file
    # check if the zip file exists, download if necessary
    if (!file.exists(zipfile)) {
        curl::curl_download(url = myUrl, destfile = zipfile)
    }
    # unzip the downloaded zip file
    unzip(zipfile = zipfile, exdir = tempdir())
}

# read the file
dat <- read_dta(dtafname)

# save as a CSV, along with timing
t0 <- Sys.time()
csvfname <- dtafname %>% str_replace(pattern = "dta", replacement = "csv")
write.csv(x = dat, file = csvfname, row.names = FALSE)
t1 <- Sys.time()
csvwrite_time <- difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "secs") %>%
    as.numeric() %>%
    round(1)

# file size
csvsize <- file.info(csvfname) %>%
    pull(size) %>%
    sprintf("%0.f", .)

# save as FST, along with timing
t0 <- Sys.time()
fstfname <- dtafname %>% str_replace(pattern = "dta", replacement = "fst")
write.fst(x = dat, path = fstfname)
t1 <- Sys.time()

# file size
fstsize <- file.info(fstfname) %>%
    pull(size) %>%
    sprintf("%0.f", .)
fstwrite_time <- difftime(time1 = t1, time2 = t0, units = "secs") %>%
    as.numeric() %>%
    round(1)
```

It took `r csvwrite_time` s to write `r csvsize` bytes as CSV, and `r fstwrite_time` s to write `r fstsize` bytes as a FST file (with the default compression amount of 50). Reading speeds are comparable.

___It should be noted___ that some file attributes will not be saved in FST format and therefore it should be used with caution if you have a highly attributed data set (e.g., a Stata DTA file with extensive labeling). You will lose those attributes! But for data sets with a simple structure, including factors, the FST format is a good option.

## Load US Census Boundary and Attribute Data as 'tidyverse' and 'sf'-Ready Data Frames: `tigris`, `tidycensus`
Dealing with US Census data can be overwhelming, particularly if using the raw text-based data. The Census Bureau has an API that allows more streamlined downloads of variables (as data frames) and geographies (as simple format shapes). It is necessary to get an API key, available for free. See [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) and  [tidycensus basic usage](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html).

`tidycensus` uses [`tigris`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tigris/versions/1.0), which downloads the geographic data portion of the census files.

### Download data
A simple example will download the variables representing the count of White, Black/African American, American Indian/Native American, and Asian persons from the American Community Survey (ACS) data for King County in 2019. For this example to run, you need to have your US Census API key installed, e.g., 

<tt>
tidycensus::census_api_key("*****************", install = TRUE)<br>
<font color="red">
Your API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY").<br>
To use now, restart R or run `readRenviron("~/.Renviron")`
</font>
</tt>

The labels from the census API are:

```
"Estimate!!Total"                                         
"Estimate!!Total!!White alone"                            
"Estimate!!Total!!Black or African American alone"        
"Estimate!!Total!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone"
"Estimate!!Total!!Asian alone" 
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
# the census variables
census_vars <- c(
    p_denom_race = "B02001_001",
    p_n_white = "B02001_002",
    p_n_afram = "B02001_003",
    p_n_aian = "B02001_004",
    p_n_asian = "B02001_005"
)

# get the data
ctdat <- get_acs(
    geography = "tract",
    variables = census_vars,
    cache_table = TRUE,
    year = 2019,
    output = "wide",
    state = "WA",
    county = "King",
    geometry = TRUE,
    survey = "acs5"
)
```

A few values are shown in Table \@ref(tab:census)

```{r census}
# print a few records
ctdat %>%
    head() %>%
    kable(caption = "Selected census tract variables from the 5-year ACS from 2019 for King County, WA") %>%
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

### Mapping census data 
A `leaflet` simple map is shown in \@ref(fig:ct), with percent African American residents and tract identifier.

```{r ct, fig.cap="Percent African American in census tracts in King County, 2019 ACS 5-year estimate", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
library(sf)

# define the CRS
st_crs(ctdat) <- 4326

# proportion Black
ctdat %<>%
    mutate(pct_black = (p_n_aframE / p_denom_raceE * 100) %>% round(1))

# a label
labels <- sprintf("%s<br/>%s%s", ctdat$GEOID, ctdat$pct_black, "%") %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)

bins <- 0:50
pal <- colorBin(
    palette = "Reds",
    domain = ctdat$pct_black,
    bins = bins
)

bins2 <- seq(0, 50, by = 10)
pal2 <- colorBin(
    palette = "Reds",
    domain = ctdat$pct_black,
    bins = bins2
)

# the leaflet map
m <- leaflet(height = "500px") %>%
    # add polygons from tracts
    addPolygons(
        data = ctdat,
        weight = 1,
        fillOpacity = 0.8,
        # fill using the palette
        fillColor = ~ pal(pct_black),
        # highlighting
        highlight = highlightOptions(
            weight = 5,
            color = "#666",
            fillOpacity = 0.7,
            bringToFront = TRUE
        ),
        # popup labels
        label = labels,
        labelOptions = labelOptions(
            style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
            textsize = "15px",
            direction = "auto"
        )
    ) %>%
    # legend
    addLegend(
        position = "bottomright", pal = pal2, values = ctdat$pct_black,
        title = "% African American",
        opacity = 1
    )

## Easier regular expressions with `RVerbalExpressions`
Regular expressions are powerful but take some time and trial-and-error to master. The `RVerbalExpresions` package can be used to more easily generate regular expressions. See the help for `rx()` and associated functions.

These examples show two constructions of regular expressions for matching two similar but different URLs.

```{r}
library(RVerbalExpressions)
# a pattern
x <- rx_start_of_line() %>%
    rx_find("http") %>%
    rx_maybe("s") %>%
    rx_find("://") %>%
    rx_maybe("www.") %>%
    rx_anything_but(" ") %>%
    rx_end_of_line()

# print the expression
(x)

# search for a pattern in some URLs
urls <- c(
    "http://www.google.com",
    "http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/"
)
grepl(pattern = x, x = urls)


# a different pattern
y <- rx_start_of_line() %>%
    rx_find("http") %>%
    rx_maybe("s") %>%
    rx_find("://") %>%
    rx_find("www.") %>%
    rx_anything_but(" ") %>%
    rx_end_of_line()

# print the expression
(y)

# search for a pattern in the two URLs, matches one, does not match the other
grepl(pattern = y, x = urls)
```

## Quick copy from Excel (Windows only)
Under Windows, it is possible to copy selected cells from an Excel worksheet directly to R. This is not an endorsement for using Excel, but there are some cases in which Excel may be able to produce some quick data that you don't want to develop in other ways.

As a demonstration, you can use [analysis.xlsx](files/words_analysis.xlsx). Download and open the file. Here is shown a selection of cells that was copied. 

![](images/week09/excel.png)

The code below shows how the data can be copied.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
xlsclip <- fst::read.fst("files/xlsclip.fst")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
xlsclip <- read.table(file = "clipboard", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

xlsclip %>%
    kable() %>%
    kable_styling(
        full_width = FALSE,
        position = "left"
    )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
xlsclip %>%
    kable() %>%
    kable_styling(
        full_width = FALSE,
        position = "left"
    )
```

## Running system commands
R can run arbitrary system commands that you would normally run in a terminal or command window. The `system()` function is used to run commands, optionally with the results returned as a character vector. Under Mac and Linux, the usage is quite straightforward, for example, to list files in a specific directory:

```
tempdirfiles <- system("ls `r tempdir()`", intern = TRUE)
```

Under Windows, it takes a bit of extra code. To do the same requires the prefix `cmd /c` in the `system()` call before the command itself. Also any backslashes in path names need to be specified as double-backslashes for R.

```{r}
# R prefers and automatically generates forward slashes
tmpdir <- dirname(tempdir())

# OS
os <- .Platform$OS.type

# construct a system command
# under Windows
if (os == "windows") {
    # under Windows, path delimiters are backslashes so need to be rendered in R as double backslashes
    tmpdir %<>% str_replace_all("/", "\\\\")
    cmd <- sprintf("cmd /c dir %s", tmpdir)
    tempdirfiles <- system(command = cmd, intern = TRUE)
}

# under *NIX
if (os == "unix") {
    cmd <- sprintf("ls %s", tmpdir)
    tempdirfiles <- system(command = cmd, intern = TRUE)
}
```

If you are running other programs or utilities that are executed in a terminal or command window, this can be very helpful.

## Code styling
Good code should meet at least the two functional requirements of getting the job done and being able able to read. Code that gets the job done but that is not easy to read will cause problems later when you try to figure out how or why you did something.

The [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package can help clean up your code so that it conforms to a specific style such as that in the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). `styler` can be integrated into RStudio for interactive use. It can reformat selected code, an entire file, or an entire project. An example is shown:

![](images/week09/styler_0.1.gif)

[`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) is also useful for identifying potential style errors.

## Session information
It may be helpful in troubleshooting or complete documentation to report the complete session information. For example, sometimes outdated versions of packages may contain errors. The session information is printed with `sessionInfo()`.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

## Comment out Rmd/HTML code
To comment out entire parts of your Rmd so they do not appear in your rendered HTML, use HTML comments, which are specified with the delimiters `<!--` and `-->`.

## Source code
[09-week09.Rmd](09-week09.Rmd)
```{r comment=''}
cat(readLines(con = "09-week09.Rmd"), sep = "\n")
```

<h2>Topic:Odds and ends</h2>
This week's lesson will cover a additional R odds and ends.

## R Markdown to Microsoft Word
Microsoft Word ("Word"), is used widely to document research. Because of its advanced word processing and "track changes" capabilities, it is commonly used for preparation of manuscripts. Using R to generate output for Word is often a tedious process (e.g., create CSV files $\rightarrow$ paste the contents $\rightarrow$ convert to table; export R graphics with `png()` or `ggsave()` $\rightarrow$ insert the file).  

RMarkdown can be used to generate Word documents. This should be thought of as a one-way operation. That is to say, when a team works on a manuscript using Word, the typical work flow is that the lead author creates the first draft. Other authors make changes to the document using tracked changes. When the manuscript circulates over all authors, the lead author decides which changes to accept and which to reject, resulting in a new version. The process continues until the group of authors agrees that the manuscript is ready for publication.

Unfortunately there is no backwards path to take an existing Word docx and regenerate an Rmd (e.g., after you and your colleagues made a lot of changes to the Word docx). Nevertheless using this method could save you some "busy work" time in Word, as well as to provide a common stylistic template for your R outputs if you will be generating Word documents.

To export to a Word document, the following work flow should be followed:

1. Create a bare-bones Rmd file that contains all of the elements you want in your output, but little actual content.
1. Render the Rmd file to a Word docx file.
1. Open the docx file in Word and make any stylistic changes __using Word styles__ (see the workshop  [Microsoft Word for the Social Sciences](https://csde.washington.edu/workshop/microsoft-word-for-the-social-sciences/))
1. Use the style-edited docx file as a template in the Rmd file.
1. Write your complete Rmd file with the content you want to have placed in the Word docx file and then render. The output docx file will have the same stylistic configuration as the template docx.

A more detailed work flow:

To use Word output, first make a minimal RMarkdown document with Word output. 

![](images/week03/20200419_233754-C__Users_phurvitz_nextcloud_uw_csde_courses_msword_soc_sci_-_RStudio.png) 

Save the Rmd file and knit to to Word.

![](images/week03/20200419_233851-Window.png) 

The output document will have the elements from the Rmd file.

![](images/week03/20200419_234510-minimal.docx_[Read-Only]_[Compatibility_Mode]_-_Word.png) 

The important part of this is that the Word document will have a number of styles. Make any changes to the styles or margins. This will become the template for the output containing the actual scientific content. ___Do not add, remove, or rename any styles in this document!___ Save a copy of the document with any stylistic changes. 

For example, here are some changes to the header styles:

![](images/week03/20200420_002233-Window.png) 

Presumably, all of the styles in the output docx can be modified:

![](images/week03/20210121_020407-Window.png)

After you have made any changes, save the file as a "template":

![](images/week03/20200419_235426-Save_As.png)

In the YAML header of the Rmd file with your scientific content, this construction, in which you specify the path name to the template document.

```
output:
  word_document:  
    reference_docx: "template.docx"
```

When the Rmd file is rendered to a Word document, the stylistic changes will be applied to the output. For example, just changing the head matter of the previous document and re-rendering shows that the heading styles were applied as defined.

![](images/week03/20200420_002536-minimal.docx_[Read-Only]_[Compatibility_Mode]_-_Word.png)

Although this overall functionality is somewhat limited, if you do have some Rmd code that generates some scientific content, and you want to output to a Word document with predefined formats, this will save you some busy work of reformatting.

## R Markdown output 
There are two different basic output formats available, document and presentation. As of this writing, the list of specific output types includes:

* `beamer_presentation`
* `context_document`
* `github_document`
* `html_document`
* `ioslides_presentation`
* `latex_document`
* `md_document`
* `odt_document`
* `pdf_document`
* `powerpoint_presentation`
* `rtf_document`
* `slidy_presentation`
* `word_document`

Various packages can also specify their own output types, e.g., `bookdown::html_document2` or `tufte::tufte_html.

### R Markdown rendering to specific formats
Rendering R Markdown files is done at the R console using the `rmarkdown::render()` function, e.g., 

```
rmarkdown::render(input = "input_filename.Rmd")
```

or by clicking the `Knit` control in RSTudio.

If the YAML header specifies multiple output formats, the first listed format will be used for the output if  other options are not specified in the `render()` function call. For example, for this header, the default output format is `bookdown::html_document2`

```
---
title: "A Document"
author: "Jane Doe"
date: "2021-01-23"
output: 
    bookdown::html_document2: default
    pdf_document: default
    html_document: default
    word_document: default
---
```

The RStudio interface will present the listed choices in the `Knit` pick list in the GUI, so the desired output format can be selected interactively:

<img src="../images/week03/20210124_010442-C__Users_phurvitz_OneDrive_uw_courses_csde502_csde502_winter_2021_course - RStud.png" class="border1">

Other supported outputs can be created, including those that are not listed in the YAML header by specifying the output format in the `render()` function, e.g. to create a [Slidy](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/#(1)) presentation: 

```
rmarkdown::render(input = "input_filename.Rmd", output_format = "slidy_presentation")
```

To render a PDF file, use e.g., 

```
rmarkdown::render(input = "input_filename.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")
```

Using code rather than the RStudio GUI allows more flexible automation; you could have an R script that runs the `render()` function as part of a multi-step workflow. For example, if you had a continuous data collection process, the work flow could be coded and run with [cron](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cronR) to generate a new PDF (or other file type) file on a daily basis.

### Testing `output_type()`
Because different output formats support (or do not support) different features, a test can be made for the output format to determine which code to run, using `is_html_output()` and `is_latex_output()`. Any R code within the Rmd file can be run or not run based on these tests. For a working example, download and render the file [output_type_test](files/output_type_test.Rmd). Using a single source, the [output rendered as HTML](files/output_type_test.html) appears as

![](images/week03/20210124_190945-R Markdown Output Type Test - Work - MicrosoftEdge.png)

whereas the [PDF output](files/output_type_test.pdf) is rendered as

![](images/week03/20210124_191706-output_type_test.pdf - [R Markdown Output Type Test] - SumatraPDF.png)

There appears to be no similar test for MS Word output, so for creating Word documents from Rmd files, it is suggested to create the Rmd from scratch with the intention of creating only Word output.

## Advantages and disadvantages of PDF
Portable document format (PDF) has a number of advantages:

1. Document formatting is maintained. Font face and positioning of elements is consistent. When some other formats are shared (e.g., MS Word), formatting is inconsistent. 
1. The format is widely used and able to be created from a variety of different proprietary and open software applications.
1. Files are often parsimonious in size. When large images are embedded, the file sizes can grow, but there are often options for down-sampling images for smaller file size.
1. Files can be protected with passwords.
1. Files are supported across all operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, UNIX).
1. Multiple different elements can be included (text, images, tables).
1. The format has stood the test of time, having been introduced 1993. The standard was opened in 2008, allowing developers to create PDF outputs. This has led to PDF being the standard for fixed-format documents. 

The disadvantages:
1. Direct editing of PDF files is not straightforward (usually requires dedicated software), and often results in undesired layout changes. Therefore this is not a good format for collaborative editing.
1. Copy-and-paste from PDF often results in missing or extra spaces or strange characters.
1. R functions that produce HTML output cannot be used in PDF outputs.

## Bibliography in R Markdown
The `pandoc` engine that performs document conversion can generate bibliographies. See [Bibliographies and Citations](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) for detailed information.

For this exercise, we will be using ${B\kern-0.1emi\kern-0.017emb}\kern-0.15em\TeX$ formatted references.

The YAML header needs to be formatted to include the bibliography file, which should either have a complete path name or be located in the same directory as the Rmd file. Similarly, any CSL (Citation Style Language) file should be specified. CSL files can be obtained from the [Zotero Style Repository
](https://www.zotero.org/styles)

The YAML header would include something of the form:

```
---
title: "My glorious, shiny dissertation"
output: 
    bookdown::html_document2
bibliography: myreferences_20200121.bib
csl: biomed-central.csl
---
```

When citations are made to references, the corresponding record will be automatically added to the end of the document.

For examples of syntax for both APA-like and AMA-like references and bibliographies, see the files 

* APA: [HTML](files/bibliography.html); [Rmd](files/bibliography.Rmd)
* AMA: [HTML](files/bibliography_ama.html); [Rmd](files/bibliography_ama.Rmd)
