## R Markdown 

### Code blocks {#rmdcodeblocks}

### Graphics in R Markdown {#rmdgraphics}
Data-driven graphics in Rmd files are typically created as base R graphics or with the `ggplot2` package. This tutorial is not intended to provide anywhere near a comprehensive treatment of creating graphics from data, but will provide instruction on some options for creating and including data-driven graphics as well as inserting graphics from image files.

See [Tips and tricks for working with images and figures in R Markdown documents](http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/) for a good explanation.

#### Base R graphics
To include base R graphics, simply place the code to generate the graphic in an R code block, e.g., using the Add Health data from last week ([AHWave1_v1.dta](data/AHWave1_v1.dta)):

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines("files/rmd_insert_text_01.txt"), sep = '\n')
```

... which will render the graph:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# since loading the data takes awhile, only do this if necessary
if(!exists("dat")){
    dat <- read.dta13("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")
}
# birth year = h1gi1y
# drop "Refused" birth year
# for birth year and interview year, replace anything before white space, convert to numeric
# subtract interview year - birth year
ages <- dat %>% 
    filter(! str_detect(h1gi1y, "Refused")) %>% 
    select(iyear, h1gi1y) %>% 
    mutate(yi = str_replace(iyear, ".*\\s", "") %>% as.numeric(),
           yb = str_replace(h1gi1y, ".*\\s", "") %>% as.numeric(),
           age = yi - yb)
hist(ages$age, xlab = "age (years)", las = 1)
```

#### `ggplot2` graphics
The `ggplot2` package creates compelling graphics that use a common syntax. The main difference between base R graphics and `ggplot2` graphics is that simply issuing the `plot()` or related command (e.g., `hist()`, `barplot()`) adds the graphic to the output, whereas with `ggplot()` it is necessary to issue a command that prints the graphic.

Following the previous example:

```{r}
# how many unique bins? 
bins <- length(unique(ages$age))

# create the graphic
g <- ggplot(data = ages, mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = bins)

# print the graphic
print(g)
```


#### Embedding graphics files
Journals frequently require graphics files to be submitted separately from the manuscript. In this case, the graphic can be created and saved as a file and then inserted in the Rmd using code, but also accessed as a a stand-alone file. Let's take the previous example, but add correlation coefficients and other embellishments, create a graphics file and add the graphics into the Rmd.

The base graphics file is created using the `pdf()` function, although `png()` also works if that is the desired output format. PDF is a vector format, so it generally renders better over different zoom levels.

```{r, message=FALSE}
pdf(file = "ah_age_hist.pdf", width = 5, height = 5)
hist(ages$age, xlab = "age (years)", las = 1)
x <- dev.off()
```

Here we create a PNG format file:

```{r, message=FALSE}
png(file = "ah_age_hist.png", width = 5, height = 5, units = "in", res = 300)
hist(ages$age, xlab = "age (years)", las = 1)
x <- dev.off()
```

`ggplot2` graphics can be saved using `ggsave()`, e.g., for both PDF and PNG outputs. The `dpi` argument is important for bitmap images.

```{r}
ggsave(
    filename = "ah_age_hist_ggplot.pdf",
    plot = g, device = "pdf",
    width = 5, height = 5
)
ggsave(
    filename = "ah_age_hist_ggplot.png",
    plot = g, device = "png", 
    width = 5, height = 5, 
    units = "in", dpi = 300
)
```

Graphics can be added using several methods.

##### `knitr`
The `knitr::include_graphics()` function can be used to insert image files, with the caution that inserted PDF files may produce unwanted results. The syntax is:

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines("files/rmd_insert_text_02.txt"), sep = '\n')
```

and the code chunk can include `out.width`, `out.height` and other options.
\  
Here we insert a PDF with no code chunk options, which presents the image with a scroll bar, rather than the full image:

```{r}
include_graphics("ah_age_hist.pdf")
```

Here we specify in the code chunk options `out.height = "360px", out.width='360px', fig.align='left'`, 

```{r, out.height = "360px", out.width='360px', fig.align='left'}
include_graphics("ah_age_hist.pdf")

```

\  

... and with code chunk options `out.height = "400px", out.width='100%', fig.align='left'`

```{r, out.height = "400px", out.width='100%', fig.align='left'}
include_graphics("ah_age_hist.pdf")
```

\  

It seems that embedding PDF files is not optimal.

Here we insert a PNG: with no code chunk options:

```{r}
include_graphics("ah_age_hist_ggplot.png")
```

and with code chunk option `out.width = "50%"`

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("ah_age_hist_ggplot.png")
```

So embedding bitmapped images appears to work better than embedding PDF files. 

##### Markdown: `![caption](filename)`

The native Markdown syntax:

```
![](filename)
```

includes a graphics file with an optional caption, e.g., here, a PDF with no caption, 

`![](ah_age_hist.pdf)`

![](ah_age_hist.pdf)

\  

The structure `![]()` indicates this is an inserted graphic; a caption can be specified by including text within the square brackets, e.g., displays the caption below the inserted image (but with no caption number!). 

```![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.pdf)```

![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.pdf)

... although it seems that inserting a PDF does odd things with image scrolling, while a PNG inserts the complete image without scroll bars.

```![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.png)```:

![Add Health respondent age histogram](ah_age_hist_ggplot.png)

##### HTML `<img>` tag
If the file is to be rendered as HTML, _and_ the image is a bitmap, rather than vector PDF graphics, the `<img>` tag can be used. Different utilities can be used to convert PDF to bitmapped formats, e.g., [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) and [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/).

```<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png">```

<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png">

Including a percentage of page width:

```<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png" width="30%">```

<img src="ah_age_hist_ggplot.png" width="30%">


### Tables in R Markdown {#rmdtables}

We will look at three methods of including tables in R Markdown documents, using the packages `knitr` (with `kableExtra`), `pander`, and `stargazer`.

For the example table, we will use the frequency table of health $\times$ White and African American from Assignment 2:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
dat <- readstata13::read.dta13("http://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/csde502_winter_2021/data/AHwave1_v1.dta")


# ordered factor; use fct_rev to establish the correct ordering where better health ranks higher
dat %<>% 
    mutate(h1gh1 = fct_rev(as.ordered(h1gh1)))

# stratify health; first we need to catch the "don't know" and "refused" as NAs
dat %<>%  
    mutate(health = 
    case_when(
        h1gh1 <= "(6) Refused" ~ as.character(NA),
        h1gh1 >  "(3) Good" ~ "high",
        h1gh1 <= "(3) Good" ~ "low"
    ))

# tabulate by White
tabhealth_white <- dat %>% 
    group_by(health, white = h1gi6a) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate("%" = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))

# tabulate by African American
tabhealth_afram <- dat %>% 
    group_by(health, afram = h1gi6b) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
    mutate("%" = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))

# column-bind and remove the second "health" column
sum_health_white_afram <- cbind(tabhealth_white, tabhealth_afram) %>% 
    select(-5)
```

#### `kntir` (`kable()`) and `kableExtra`
The simple table using `kable()` is not too nice to read.

```{r}
kable(sum_health_white_afram)
```

So we add some `kabelExtra` options, :

```{r}
kable(sum_health_white_afram,
      col.names = c("health", "race", "n", "%", "race", "n", "%")) %>% 
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left") 
```

However, because some column names are duplicated, it is necessary to add some column grouping:

```{r}
kable(sum_health_white_afram,
      col.names = c("health", "race", "n", "%", "race", "n", "%")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left") %>% 
    add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "White" = 3, "African American" = 3))
```

We could also add some row groupings:

```{r}

sum_health_white_afram %>% 
    select(-1) %>% 
    kable(col.names = c("race", "n", "%", "race", "n", "%"), align=c(rep('r',times=6))) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "left") %>% 
    add_header_above(c("White" = 3, "African American" = 3)) %>% 
    pack_rows("health high", 1, 4) %>% 
    pack_rows("health low", 5, 8) %>% 
    pack_rows("health N/A", 9, 12)
```

#### `stargazer`
The [`stargazer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf) package is especially good for PDF outputs, but is fairly limited for HTML output.

```{r results='asis'}
stargazer(sum_health_white_afram, 
          type = "html", 
          summary = FALSE,
          rownames = FALSE)
```

#### `pander`
`pander` can be used to create output HTML tables as well, although also with fewer options than `knitr` with `kableExtra`.

```{r}
pander(sum_health_white_afram)
```

### Captions to support tables, figures, and equations {#rmdcaptions}
There are several ways to support captions in R Markdown. The two main requirements for good captions: (1) automatic sequential numbering, and (2) ability to cross-reference.

Here are some options for adding captions:

#### Figures

##### R Markdown code chunk `fig.cap`
Code chunks can include `fig_cap` as an option, as shown below. However, in standard Rmd $\rightarrow$ HTML there does not appear to be a method for cross-referencing. The code chunk would look like

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines("files/rmd_insert_text_03.txt"), sep = '\n')
```


```{r plotcars, fig.cap="Cars: speed and distance", echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

##### `bookdown` with `html_document2` output type

Using the `bookdown` package with `html_document2` output type, it is possible to cross-reference using the chunk name. For example, download and run this code [fig_cap_bookdown.Rmd](files/fig_cap_bookdown.Rmd)

Which renders a file:

![](images/week03/fig_ref.png)

There seems to be no difference in the HTML output using

```
output: 
    bookdown::html_document2:
```

versus 

```
output: 
    html_document:
````

so the former is suggested as one way to include captions that support cross-referencing.

#### Tables: `kable()` "caption"
Tables created with `kable()` can include the `caption` option. For example:

```{r}
kable(x = sum_health_white_afram, caption = "Self-reported health by race")
```

But there appears to be no direct way of cross-referencing within standard Rmd $\rightarrow$ HTML.

##### `bookdown` with `html_document2` output type

Similarly for figures, the `bookdown` package with `html_document2` output type, it is possible to cross-reference using the chunk name. For example, download and run this code [table_cap_bookdown.Rmd](files/table_cap_bookdown.Rmd)

Which renders a file:

![](images/week03/tab_ref.png)

#### Equations {# rmdequations}
Equations should be numbered in manuscripts. Using `bookdown` makes this quite easy. The equations themselves require $\LaTeX$ syntax. There are numerous web sites with examples and tutorials for creating mathematical expressions with $\LaTeX$ In this example, we include Einstein's famous equation:

<pre>
\begin{equation}
  E=mc^2
  (\#eq:emc)
\end{equation}
</pre>

and the sum of squares:

<pre>
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
  (\#eq:sumn)
\end{equation}
</pre>

The label for the equation is set with `(\#eq:emc)` and can be referenced using `\@ref(eq:emc)`. Operationalized, we see:

Einstein's equation, energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light is shown in \@ref(eq:emc).

\begin{equation}
  E=mc^2
  (\#eq:emc)
\end{equation}

To make a sum of squares of _n_ first integers, see \@ref(eq:sumn).

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
  (\#eq:sumn)
\end{equation}


### `captioner` for any captioning and cross-referencing figures and tables
The `captioner` package provides a flexible, albeit cumbersome, framework for captioning both tables and figures. 

The R code to do this:

```
library(captioner)
table_nums <- captioner(prefix = "Table")
figure_nums <- captioner(prefix = "Figure")
```

The `table_nums()` and `figure_nums()` functions are used to create captions and cross-references, and are not tied to any specific figure or table, as is the case with `kable` table captions and R code chunk `fig.cap`.

A caption is created, e.g., for a figure:

`` `r
figure_nums(name = "figname", caption = "My Caption")` ``

and referenced, e.g., 

`` `r
figure_nums(name = "figname", display = "cite")` ``

It does not matter whether the reference precedes or comes after the caption itself.

Another benefit to using `captioner` is that the output can be formatted using markdown syntax. For example, to format the caption in italics, use underscores:

`` _`r
figure_nums(name = "figname", caption = "My Caption")`_ ``

Although this method requires a bit more coding, it allows great flexibility. A complete example:

As shown in `r figure_nums(name = "ageplot", display = "cite")`, the distribution of age has a slight negative skew.

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
# how many unique bins? 
bins <- length(unique(ages$age))

# create the graphic
g <- ggplot(data = ages, mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = bins)

# print the graphic
print(g)
```

_`r figure_nums(name = "ageplot", caption = "Add Health age histogram")`_

Similarly, we can present the same data as a frequency table, as shown in `r table_nums(name = "agetab", display = "cite")`.

_`r table_nums(name = "agetab", caption = "Add Health age frequency table")`_

```{r}
ages %>% 
    group_by(age) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    mutate(cumsum = cumsum(n),
        "%" = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1),
        "cum %" = round(cumsum(n / sum(n) * 100), 1)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
        c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
        full_width = F, 
        position = "left") 
```
